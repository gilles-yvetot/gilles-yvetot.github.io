		<description><![CDATA[With reference﻿ to &#039;navigate constantly&#039; there is such a thing as over-navigating. I don&#039;t agree that you have to know precisely where you are at all times; documented position﻿ fixes every five to ten minutes and being able to deduce a likely position between fixes is enough. Obviously if you&#039;re negotiating  tricky or complicated airspace these fixes must be more regular but when students try to constantly pinpoint their position their ability to maintain a heading and altitude goes out of the window, as does the lookout for traffic. I do agree though that cockpit management is absolutely paramount. A final point - I would have liked to see &#039;Aviate&#039; appear at the beginning of the video as it is, after all, the highest priority. Aviate, navigate, communicate! ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I often screw up my radio calls.  Luckily I fly from an uncontrolled airport where everyone is understanding of radio mistakes.  When I have to go to other airports - especially controlled ones - on cross country flights I write what I have to say on sticky notes and put them on the instrument panel if there&#039;s room (don&#039;t cover up dials!) or on the side of my nav logs.  I usually don&#039;t need them but if I freeze up when talking to a tower they come in quite handy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Jason,
I am eleven, so I not like a certified pilot or anything, but i try to get as much info as possible to be ready, and to save money, on flight school. that is an acceptable explanation (i hope) for the question im about to ask: what is squawk? that was probably a real dumb question.]]></description>
