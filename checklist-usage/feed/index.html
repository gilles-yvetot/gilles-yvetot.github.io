		<description><![CDATA[I am the checklist king. I teach my students to have a mental checklist and flow pattern and then go to the written checklist, the done list. So that equals 3 lists. The written checklist is my final check because as human beings we can get distracted by passengers, other pilots, tower control etc. The written checklist makes sure you have not forgotten anything. From my IMSAFE checklist, to my walking into the hanger big picture checklist, to my preflight checklist, to my CIGARS checklist, to my post takeoff checklist, to my cruise checklist to my pre-landing checklist, to my CGUMPS or GUMPS checklist to my off the runway checklist, to my shut down checklist. They all make sure I or my students do not miss anything that is important to the flight. I am an older dude and I remember a Peanuts comic strip that said, and I am paraphrasing, &quot;I have never made a mistake in my life, I thought I did once, but I was wrong.&quot;

		<description><![CDATA[I enjoy everything you do! But when were these changes made? Im not a pilot, but I was listening to &quot;The Finer Points&quot; audio podcast epsiode #1, &quot;Check the do list.&quot; He cites what you just read out of the FAA handbook, word for word. And also elaborates on it like you did, however that podcast was released in 2005. Also, I tried to give you 5 stars, but for some reason it looks like -8 stars.... didnt think that was possible. Keep it up!]]></description>
