		<description><![CDATA[Hey Jason, Yeah the short field landing was my nemesis during the checkride.  I blew it not just once, but twice.  So guess what, I got to fly my DPE around the patch a second time...two weeks later.  I nailed it that time, and have my ticket to prove it!  In no small part due to the helpful material on MzeroA.com.

The trick is that short field landings are very sensitive to headwind.  To the point where a headwind seems to make the short field landing a bit easier. I carry a little power as I level off, when my nose passes the landing point I cut power and it drops the foot or so to the tarmac like right now. Bam, its nailed.   

However, if no tailwind, I don&#039;t carry any power and focus like a laser beam ahead of the landing point.  If I&#039;m coming in a little short I&#039;ll add throttle to make the  point.  What makes it difficult with no headwind is judging when to cut throttle.  Too soon and I&#039;m in the dirt, too late and the numbers are behind me.

		<description><![CDATA[Absolutely!

2 options in that situation. Pick up the nose a few degrees or add the extra flaps if you have them.

When I came across the numbers I was 60 slowing to 55 and touched down right around 55

		<description><![CDATA[Great question!

And it like you said is really a mesh between the two. In the 2nd video it worked out nice because we used &quot;Aerodynamic braking&quot; (Flaps up, pull back on the yoke) The takes the weight off the nose wheel (the goal of a soft field) and still helps you stop efficiently.

		<description><![CDATA[Jason,
       With a short field like you domo&#039;d, you stated your airspeed was a little fast, did you raise the nose a bit to slow down and just curious, but what did you land at. 60 ? 

Thanks,
Jason ]]></description>
