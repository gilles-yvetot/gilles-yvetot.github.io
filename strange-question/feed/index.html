		<description><![CDATA[Here is Robert&#039;s story he emailed me! ...Makes you think for sure&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was an airdale in the USCG, Scanner/Dropmaster on C130s to be exact.  We where  on a training flight, do touches and goes, missed approaches, etc. Over the ics ( internal communication system)  I here the aircraft commander say. what the H*LL. Just as I look out of the port forward window, I see a C150,going just under engines 1 &amp;  2 . I can still see that sight, 32 years later. The c150 was close enough for me to see the rivets on the wings.    I can only imagination the wild ride the&lt;br&gt;pilot of the Cessna had in the wake of the C-130.  Don&#039;t assume that other aircraft can see you, or if they do, that they will react as they are supposed too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting I just e-mailed Jason some stories, after viewing his new video series.  I was an aircrew( Scanner/Dropmaster)  on USCG  C130s close to 30 years ago.  One of the stories I related to Jason was about a training flight at PIE  and a Cessna 150.   I won&#039;t repeat it here.   Jason you did the right &lt;br&gt;thing, a 130 produces a lot of turbulence on take off.    Jason,  the Coast Guard Air Station at PIE is&lt;br&gt;also a training station, plus the receiving, and delivery station for C130 going to and coming out of &lt;br&gt;overhaul at Lake City.   Not just new pilots, the pilots and crew are constantly  training.&lt;br&gt;So in Florida a least, you may meet a  C130 at most of airport that can handle them..]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Mike!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The C-130 was coast guard so he was doing practice with some new pilots most likely. (Thus the touch and go&#039;s) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So you&#039;re correct you&#039;ve now got wake turbulence no matter which way you choose.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here&#039;s the breakdown on wake time limits by ATC&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If YOU ask for your wake seperation time ATC must give it to you. However THEY are NOT required to offer it. (silly I know, so pilots must educated themselves and know to ask for it) Now that&#039;s not saying a kind controller won&#039;t offer, some do..&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taking off behind a heavy aircraft 3 mins&lt;br&gt;Landing behind a heavy aircraft 2 mins&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wake vorticites tend to descend at a rate of 300 to 500fpm for the first 30 seconds then spread out and downward at a much slower rate as they begin to dissipate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So 3 and 2 mins are pretty safe&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jason]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Also what is that ATC time that they are forced to wait if you request an intersection take off after departing traffic that might suggest wake turbulence.  Is it 6 minutes?  Wonder where they get that figure.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yep, that would be kind of weird.  Wonder if it is common to see that large of a aircraft doing touch and goes.  With touch and goes you would have the turbulence both in the approach and departure sides of the runway, even given that he was on the opposite runway from you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would have probably asked for the 360, at least I hope I would.  Not sure I would switch runways, given that there would be turbulence on both sides anyway right?  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not sure how long it takes a C-130 to roll on touch and goes, but I imagine it might be hard to do the whole &#039;stay above on approach and stop before their rotation shtick&#039;.  Maybe not, those things are pretty big.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks!  Unfortunately I was unable to make it to OSH this year.  I need to start planning for next year--I will make it one of these times.  I am keeping the week full of aviation, though, despite my absence from OSH.   As an example, I went to the CAMI basic survival course today.  I highly recommend any FAA CAMI course you can get to.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Another great article and learning moment. Thank you Jason...When we stop thinking is when we get in trouble. You are forcing a lot of us to think about situations before we actually get into them...I thought you made the right decision. I might have even just turned left and flown out of the pattern for a few minutes. I&#039;m surprised ATC was not more concerned...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Waiting certainly was the prudent thing to do.  Thinking this over, with calm winds I would expect the wake to descend and not really drift anywhere else.  The C-130 has a 1830 fpm ascent (according to Wikipedia) and as such even if you had planned to land beyond the point their wheels left the ground you would likely be flying through the wake to get there.  Another option could have been to request 36, which still gives a delay for the wake to dissipate.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Since wake turbulence descends at roughly five hundred feet per minute, waiting someplace is the thing to do. You don&#039;t want to be doing your 360 in a place where the wake turbulence might be blown by the prevailing wind, so if there&#039;s a right crosswind do your 360 on the right side of the field. That way the turbulence will be blown to the left and away from your aircraft.]]></description>
