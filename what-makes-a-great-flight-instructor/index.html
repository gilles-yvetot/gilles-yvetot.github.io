<h2 style="text-align: center;">Text Transcript</h2>
<p>Hey everyone, Jason Schappert here of MzeroA.com.</p>
<p>Last week, I posted a really great question. &#8220;What makes a great pilot?&#8221; I got a ton of responses to this. One of you guys said, Avoid complacency. Always learning, which is the real principle we really teach here at MzeroA.com.</p>
<p>But one person said something that really sparked my interest. They said, a great pilot is made by a great flight instructor. And I really agree with that because a flight instructor is responsible for giving that good base.</p>
<p>In the US, the pilot (after you pass your checkride, after soloing during your training) is responsible for going out and continuing your education because a good pilot really is always learning.</p>
<p>But I really believe that the flight instructor is there to do that solid base to help you build good study habits and have it all come together and make sense.</p>
<p>So now I put the question today, &#8220;What do you think makes a great flight instructor?&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, again, I want you leave your comment at MzeroA.com underneath this video. But I may give you my piece of advice for this, what my opinion is for this. Maybe you agree and maybe you don&#8217;t agree. But one thing I find and one thing I think really makes a great flight instructor is, when looking for a flight instructor, you need to find one that is full time.</p>
<p>I know that in these tough economic times it&#8217;s hard to find anybody that&#8217;s full time at something now. Lots of people have different side jobs. They&#8217;re doing different things. Now, how can you be full time and fully devoted to your training if you have an instructor that is only part-time devoted to you?</p>
<p>So, you really need to think about that. I&#8217;m not saying part time instructors are bad. If you just wanna fly on the weekends, a part-time instructor can make it done. However, if you wanna fly two or three times per week and really knock it up, and really get the most bang for you buck, save money on your training and knock it all up, be a safe, great pilot&#8230; I really recommend finding a full time flight instructor.</p>
<p>That is just my opinion, maybe you agree, maybe you disagree.</p>
<p>But I wanna hear what you guys think. What qualities make a great flight instructor. Is it personality? Is it knowledge? What qualities of character&#8230; what makes a great flight instructor. Go ahead and go to MzeroA.com if you&#8217;re not already there. Scroll down beneath this video and leave me a comment. You don&#8217;t have to register or anything like that; just go ahead and type your comment in there and you know you&#8217;ll get a response from me.</p>
<p>I really appreciate that guys. I can&#8217;t wait to see what you guys have to say. And most importantly, remember, a good pilot is always learning. Have a great day, guys. See ya.</p><span class="et_social_bottom_trigger"></span>					</div> <!-- .entry-content -->

<p>Everyone will have a different definition of what makes a good attitude good, but I&#8217;d define it as one that can stay calmer than the student, has a sense of humor, and while remaining professional, isn&#8217;t afraid to have a personality. (The antithesis of this isn&#8217;t a good prospect!)</p>

The instructor must be very confident (short of Cocky)  and instill this confidence to the student. Also, trust the student &#8211; once he/she has proven to be able to learn the skills well. My instructor had a lot of confidence in me (or so he made it seem) which made me feel confident in what I was doing. Also when screwed up he made sure I knew it&#8230;but when I did something well, he made sure I knew that too&#8230;.this is also important.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-4841" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Hello Jason and welcome back to the real world. I hope you and your new bride had a wonderful time away.</p>
<p>Throughout my training I saw a few things that I had a problem with. 1) An instructor that would leave me in the dark about what was to come on our next flight and 2) I could always tell when an instructor was using his position to just build time for the airlines. </p>
<p>I believe any instruction time should start with review of the last session, then talk over that days adventure, leading to the flight, then the post flight debrief, and finally the home work which will lead into the next lesson. I can’t tell you how many times I went to train to only get “The Flight” and that’s it.</p>
<p>Secondly, you can or at least I could tell when an instructor was just trying to build time and log as many check rides as possible. There is nothing wrong with using an instructor’s position to build time but if you’re going to be an instructor right now then be an instructor right now. It is easy to tell where your instructor’s heart is at (airlines, extra money, etc). </p>
<p>Great questions Jason. Thanks for your site. Love it.</p>

I am a professional technical instructor, and through the years have taught other instructors how to teach technical things, as well as teaching many technical things myself. Let me put this as simply as possible- all the things people are saying here about 1.being competent and skilled at flying, 2. passion for flying, 3. personality, 4.devotion to the student- these things are all correct! the real X-factor to make a great CFI is as it is with most any profession- an extreme giftedness to teach people how to do something. Just like ball players and other atheletes, scouts look for those who are truly gifted. Can you be a Great CFI without this gift? Yes, but it will not come naturally, and those people who are not gifted will have to work 5 times harder then those it comes naturally to. Like the ball player who is all passion and not so much on the skill. He (or she) can work themselves up to that level by sheer might. In school, didn&#8217;t you just hate that person that never studied and made all A&#8217;s? They were gifted in that way, and it was easy to them. These folks are difficult to find, and flight schools don&#8217;t always go looking for &#8216;gifted &#8216; instructors. Everyone knows that new pilots often become CFI&#8217;s to build time. shame on you. If you don&#8217;t want to teach, don&#8217;t endanger others because you want the time, cranking out frustrated pilots looking for direction. Or worse, taking people&#8217;s money and then failing them when the money runs out. Teach becasue you want to teach- and go get the skills for it if you don&#8217;t have them. Are you gifted? Even better. All the things mentioned are just ingredients in the cake. But what bakes them together to actually make the cake it the desire to pass on what you know. A desire so strong that you set it as a priority, and you focus on each student, and learn how that individual best learns. They are all different. Greatness finds that way for each student.</p>

<p>I hate to disagree with you, but I think you&#8217;re wrong about a great flight instructor being full-time. My CFI and I got through my primary training in three months and 40.0 hours. Flight instruction was his side gig that he did for fun.  </p>
<p>The instructors I&#8217;ve been disappointed with have been kids who are using their CFI as a means to an end (generally building time for their ATP). My experience is that they too often lack the passion for instructing and bringing people into aviation. Obviously there will be exceptions to this. </p>
<p>What makes a great instructor to me is someone who cares about what they do: teaching aviation to students. This means caring about their student&#8217;s goals, performance, safety, and attitude. They listen to their students concerns, and try to improve their own performance and the service they provide. </p>
<p>If a student isn&#8217;t meshing with his/her instructor well, a great instructor will recommend the student to another instructor, in hopes that the other instructor will be a better fit. The great instructor will then try to learn why they weren&#8217;t successful with the student.</p>

<p>I was really disappointed with Jason&#8217;s across the board discounting of Part Time Instructors.  If you really think it through, the reason many (not all) Part Time instructors are instructing is because they have a real passion for flying and want to share that passion.  They do it because they want to, not because they HAVE to as is the case for many Full Time instructors.</p>
<p>I understand what Jason was TRYING to say, however, I feel his comments were misguided and somewhat ignorant as well.</p>

<p>I instruct because I love what I do, since I love it so much I do it full time. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m dedicated to creating safer pilots through education.</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with part-time CFI&#8217;s however like Chris mentioned above the shoe may not fit&#8230; Depends on circumstance.</p>

I am a brand new Rotorcraft CFI with a full time job not involved in aviation.  I did my private, commercial, and CFI training with a part time instructor.  I trained on an average of twice a week (of course I did alot of studying on my own time).  Now, I&#8217;m hoping to instruct part time.  </p>
<p>The CFI has to put his students&#8217; best interest first.  If a student is looking to train twice a day every day, then probably a part time instructor isn&#8217;t going to work.  If a student has a job, school, or family; maybe a part time CFI is the way to go because he/she understands being busy.  Hey, just my opinion.</p>

<p>DON&#8217;T EVER APOLOGIZE FOR DISAGREE WITH ME!</p>
<p>No need to&#8230; Do it in a civilized manner (which you did) and we&#8217;re cool!</p>
<p>This website needs some good debate anyways <img src="../wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Let me explain further&#8230;</p>
<p>My take on this is, a full time CFI is not a time builder. They are there for you through thick and thin no airline, or charter dreams, won&#8217;t leave you high and dry, don&#8217;t need to pad a wallet.</p>
<p>Now there are A TON of CFI&#8217;s that are part-time which i&#8217;m sure have all those qualities.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had them both</p>
<p>I guess I was speaking from a certain bias being a full time CFI myself and being burned by so many time-builders&#8230; Just being honest.</p>
<p>Thanks for keeping the comments real,</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-4852" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Jason, another great question to throw to the audience !! I have been very fortunate to have some great CFI&#8217;s and there are quite a few traits that make the full package. I wont say a great instructor is born over night. with time, the CFI garners more skill and experience in putting things across clearly to the student but there must be some underlying qualities. I will say these include a passion for aviation, being willing to teach and a desire to share that love of flying with others. A great CFI is one who has that student/instructor and can really know exactly what that student is thinking and knows his strengths/weaknesses. Great CFI&#8217;s are far and few between. One who instills good airman ship and his wealth of experience from day 1. Someone a student can aspire to be like. A great CFI is one who delivers a high quality product to the FAA Examiner for the check ride. </p>

<p>shows up on time and is prepared, does not ask the student &#8220;what are we doing today&#8221;</p>
<p>follows the student to the plane and observes the preflight and teaches as the student<br />
is preflighting.</p>
<p>briefs the student before the flight, debriefs the student after the flight, including,<br />
what will be the next lesson.</p>
<p>respects the money being spent, looks for ways to help save money.</p>
<p>calls the student when conditions favor a certain procedure, takes the initative to<br />
say, &#8220;today is a good day for cross wind landings&#8221; as an example.</p>
<p>keep a notebook on all his students with observations on what needs attention.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-4855" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Jason, I respect your opinions but I must disagree with the insinuation that full-time instructors are automatically better. In getting my certificate I had 5 instructors, 3 are &#8216;full-time&#8217;, 2 are &#8216;part-time in that they hold other non-aviation jobs&#8230; all with the same FBO. Even the 2 &#8216;full-timers&#8217; weren&#8217;t full-time instructors, they spent as much time flying charters, etc. as they did instructing. All were different in personality, methods, etc. but 4 were good and 1 was lousy in my opinion. Of the 2 best ones, 1 was full-time and 1 was part-time. The lousy one was full-time! </p>
<p>From what I&#8217;ve read and heard from many others, there are more poor instructors out there than good ones. For what it&#8217;s worth, from what I know about you I think you&#8217;re probably one of the good ones. </p>
<p>Good ones are outstanding pilots themselves, they have excellent judgement, they are mature in attitude (and I don&#8217;t necessarily mean age as mine ranged from 23 to 50-something). They have the students best interest at heart and it&#8217;s not just superficial. They don&#8217;t milk the students for more hours. They know how to teach and &#8216;handle&#8217; various student personalities. They have empathy. They don&#8217;t hesitate to get on a student, hard if necessary, when needed&#8230; but they also don&#8217;t hesitate to shower a student with praise when justified. They try hard to keep a student&#8217;s enthusiasm up, and don&#8217;t kick a student when he/she is down. They treat you as a friend as well as a customer, yet know how to draw the line.  They challenge a student, yet don&#8217;t overload a student. They make learning to fly FUN, not a drudgery.  I could go on &amp; on.</p>
<p>Students for their private certificates are new at this, it&#8217;s a leap of faith for them, and an expensive one at that. They start out putting all their faith in their instructor, completely trusting him or her.  They just don&#8217;t know any better at this point. They don&#8217;t know, don&#8217;t realize if they&#8217;ve got a good, bad, or so-so instructor until well into it with many dollars spent because they just don&#8217;t know.  Sometimes they don&#8217;t even know until well after the fact, after the checkride, if their wallet has been taken for a ride.  Too often it&#8217;s only after the fact, in hindsight after they&#8217;ve been in/around aviation a while that they come to realize there&#8217;s often a big difference in instructors. </p>
<p>Just because a person has a CFI rating doesn&#8217;t automatically mean they are good instructors&#8230;. and the same goes for full-time. </p>

<p>You&#8217;re correct just because you&#8217;re full time doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re going to be great or even good. </p>

<p>I am also going to have to respectfully disagree with your comments about finding a full time instructor.  I am a part time instructor&#8230; I am not a time builder or shopping for hours.  I do it because I LOVE FLYING and I love sharing it with my students.  Unfortunately, living in the heart of Wyoming, we simply do not have the student base to provide a living off of.  Thus the reason it is part time. (remember we have less than 500,000 people in the whole state)</p>
<p>One thing that I have always tried to do was expose my students to other instructors and other thoughts and techniques about flying.  In doing that, I always provide them with your website.  I think that your energy for flying is second to none.  Having said that, one of my students who I flew with this morning commented on this very posting.  He was wondering if he &#8220;shouldn&#8217;t just take a couple of weeks off and go to Denver&#8221; in an effort to get his license finished up. Because, as he put it &#8220;I am just a part time instructor!&#8221;</p>
<p>I doubt that your expected this type of response from your video.  But I think that I should tell you what happens when so many people take your words to heart and view you as an aviation authority.  I absolutely agree with the idea behind the question you asked.  However, I have to say that your comments were simply not cool. Especially to those of us who are part time instructors and are sending students to your website in an effort to expose them to other opinions about flying.</p>
<p>Now to the question at hand&#8230; a great instructor is someone who is in it with one goal in mind.  That is the success of his or her student.  The great instructor sets aside a biases and teaches from the heart. He shares his passion for aviation with all who will listen.  He makes the future of aviation, one pilot at a time.</p>
<p>Jason please don&#8217;t think I am being too harsh.  I am simply expressing my disappointment in your comments.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Andrew_Hanson</p>

<p>As a fellow Twitter friend i&#8217;m not upset at all by your comments</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve been a blessing to myself and my business and I thank you for that!</p>
<p>As you know I would never intend for someone to &#8220;go else where&#8221; or drop their CFI altogether. My words are being taken out of context.</p>
<p>First off you DON&#8217;T fall into the category i&#8217;m talking about. You&#8217;re an awesome CFI and not part-time by choice as you said!</p>
<p>What students need to realize is that you need to find a CFI that fits your schedule.</p>
<p>Do you just want to fly weekends? Well then a part-time may rock for you. Do you want to fly during the week 3 times per week?</p>
<p>Maybe look for a full-time guy.</p>
<p>It depends on what&#8217;s best for the student.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re still the man my friend and I hope you continue to send your students to MzeroA</p>
<p>Many Blessings,</p>

In regards to this subject  I think a good instructor is one who has a Passion for what he is doing and it will not become  work  a whole lot of instructors consider instructing as a job/work and there passion is at an all time low, passion is the   key to success in everything especially instructing see &#8221; people don&#8217;t care to know how much you know unless there know how much you care&#8221;  Jason you have passion and Mike who commented yesterday have passion this is what makes up a good instructor along with the good qualities Mike talked about. You guys are the greatest keep up the great work Jason you are an excellent help to a lot of pilots and even though you may not see me comment I am always observing and I know what you mean when you talk about good wheather I am from The Bahamas !!!!!!!!!!! lol Have a great day Sir.</p>

In addition, I do agree with Jason that a great CFI needs to be full-time, because teaching is not a side job: it is a full-time job. A good instructor needs dedication, and alot of CFIs now these days are just trying to get their flight hours in until they become airline pilots. Hopefully, my flight instructor will be full-time.</p>

The one I flew with on the days my primary wasn&#8217;t available, was awesome at it. I&#8217;d be stuck, and then I&#8217;d fly with Dave, and he&#8217;d know exactly how to get me unstuck. </p>

I have read many of the posts below and most are spot on in terms of airmanship, efficiency, and personality. I think there has been one thing no one has mentioned(or I didnt see it). A great CFI understands that they cannot teach someone to fly but rather guides them along while the student learns to fly. The student pilot must be given the room to figure out the stick and rudder skills. The CFI allows the students to make mistakes without compromising safety of course. My first instructor is a great pilot but as a new CFI, he had a lot to learn about instructing. Just my 2 cents, Thanks for the great videos.   </p>

You do a great job explaining things, and I really appreciate your dedication to making pilots safer! I just passed my commercial checkride a few days ago and am really considering going on to get my CFI. I enjoy teaching and think I might be a good CFI. After reading all the comments on this video, I think I have most of the qualities (aside from qualities I would only know I had if I actually taught someone to fly). I&#8217;m definitely not trying to brag&#8211; just trying to give you some context for my questions:</p>
<p>My question to you is do you have any tips for or telltale signs of being a good CFI? Also, do you have any suggestions of what to do to become a great CFI? I definitely would like to know if I&#8217;m good or have the potential qualities of a good CFI before I spend the money to become one. </p>
