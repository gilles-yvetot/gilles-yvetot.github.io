		<description><![CDATA[Jason, I found your website through youtube about two weeks ago, and I think I have watched most (if not all) of your videos. You do a great job explaining things, and I really appreciate your dedication to making pilots safer! I just passed my commercial checkride a few days ago and am really considering going on to get my CFI. I enjoy teaching and think I might be a good CFI. After reading all the comments on this video, I think I have most of the qualities (aside from qualities I would only know I had if I actually taught someone to fly). I&#039;m definitely not trying to brag-- just trying to give you some context for my questions:

My question to you is do you have any tips for or telltale signs of being a good CFI? Also, do you have any suggestions of what to do to become a great CFI? I definitely would like to know if I&#039;m good or have the potential qualities of a good CFI before I spend the money to become one. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice video. Thanks for
providing the informative article on commercial flight training programs.
Commercial pilot training programs are conducted in many schools and colleges.
The person who gets the commercial pilot license is eligible to fly the planes.
Training sessions of Commercial Pilot Training are helpful for the students to
learn about the flying process and in these training sessions, the students can
learn more and more about the techniques of flying.

		<description><![CDATA[nice question you asked there,  i think to be a professional you need to be full time and the more you fly the more experience you get, but i think the best quality of an instructor pilot is error analysis. if the instructor is unable to find the root cause of the errors the student makes every time he cant teach him the right way of doing things.  To find the root cause of the error  you must have experience. so i think the instructor should be full time and have lots of experience even if he him self is not good in flying but that experience will let him be comfortable and monitor students errors. once the error is identified a number of methods can be used to rectify it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jason, 
I have read many of the posts below and most are spot on in terms of airmanship, efficiency, and personality. I think there has been one thing no one has mentioned(or I didnt see it). A great CFI understands that they cannot teach someone to fly but rather guides them along while the student learns to fly. The student pilot must be given the room to figure out the stick and rudder skills. The CFI allows the students to make mistakes without compromising safety of course. My first instructor is a great pilot but as a new CFI, he had a lot to learn about instructing. Just my 2 cents, Thanks for the great videos.   ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Someone who is very patient. An instructor who remembers what it was like the first 10 hours of flying. Someone who takes the time to explain everything carefully before you get in the plane. Someone who is very encouraging all the time and calls you up to ask how your life is going and how you are feeling. He/She never gets frustrated with you. Everyone learns at a different pace. Someone who is understanding when life gets in the way and you have to postpone lessons due to money/time/family problems. And someone who won&#039;t let you settle for less than top notch, safe piloting skills. ]]></description>

As a CFI you must have high standards! And impress the same model upon your students just like you said!

		<description><![CDATA[Daniel,

Thanks for your great comment! You&#039;re so very right! A CFI needs that desire and that passion to wake up every morning loving what they do and rocking it each day.

		<description><![CDATA[A good CFI, among the other things mentioned here, is creative. If the student isn&#039;t learning the way the CFI is teaching, he needs to find a different way to pass along the knowledge. The CFI I spent the most time with so far, not so good at this. The one I flew with on the days my primary wasn&#039;t available, was awesome at it. I&#039;d be stuck, and then I&#039;d fly with Dave, and he&#039;d know exactly how to get me unstuck. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As a tutor, whenever I teach a student something I need patience, good leadership skills, and a DESIRE to be instructing. I believe the same would apply to what makes a great CFI.
In addition, I do agree with Jason that a great CFI needs to be full-time, because teaching is not a side job: it is a full-time job. A good instructor needs dedication, and alot of CFIs now these days are just trying to get their flight hours in until they become airline pilots. Hopefully, my flight instructor will be full-time.]]></description>

Never assume is huge! Too many CFI&#039;s forget that their students may not know it all. That&#039;s why they should be doing like what Wefly said below... Keep a notebook

Best website ever? Well according to flightglobal.com I&#039;m only number 2 :) but I appreciate your fair weather forecasting of the future :)

Passion is a huge part of being an instructor and that carry&#039;s over to the student as well.

I hope you continue to leave valuable comments and follow along with all the crazy MzeroA happenings

If you ever hop over to Florida give me a buzz i&#039;m based at X35 North Central Florida area

		<description><![CDATA[Andrew,

As a fellow Twitter friend i&#039;m not upset at all by your comments

You&#039;ve been a blessing to myself and my business and I thank you for that!

As you know I would never intend for someone to &quot;go else where&quot; or drop their CFI altogether. My words are being taken out of context.

First off you DON&#039;T fall into the category i&#039;m talking about. You&#039;re an awesome CFI and not part-time by choice as you said!

What students need to realize is that you need to find a CFI that fits your schedule.

Do you just want to fly weekends? Well then a part-time may rock for you. Do you want to fly during the week 3 times per week?

Maybe look for a full-time guy.

It depends on what&#039;s best for the student.

You&#039;re still the man my friend and I hope you continue to send your students to MzeroA

Many Blessings,

Jason

		<description><![CDATA[Hello Jason this is the best ever web site that I know at this point where the host is so interactive with his viewers and this is my first post on this site thank you for all your concerns for your pilots.

		<description><![CDATA[Jason - 

I am also going to have to respectfully disagree with your comments about finding a full time instructor.  I am a part time instructor... I am not a time builder or shopping for hours.  I do it because I LOVE FLYING and I love sharing it with my students.  Unfortunately, living in the heart of Wyoming, we simply do not have the student base to provide a living off of.  Thus the reason it is part time. (remember we have less than 500,000 people in the whole state)

One thing that I have always tried to do was expose my students to other instructors and other thoughts and techniques about flying.  In doing that, I always provide them with your website.  I think that your energy for flying is second to none.  Having said that, one of my students who I flew with this morning commented on this very posting.  He was wondering if he &quot;shouldn&#039;t just take a couple of weeks off and go to Denver&quot; in an effort to get his license finished up. Because, as he put it &quot;I am just a part time instructor!&quot;

I doubt that your expected this type of response from your video.  But I think that I should tell you what happens when so many people take your words to heart and view you as an aviation authority.  I absolutely agree with the idea behind the question you asked.  However, I have to say that your comments were simply not cool. Especially to those of us who are part time instructors and are sending students to your website in an effort to expose them to other opinions about flying.

Now to the question at hand... a great instructor is someone who is in it with one goal in mind.  That is the success of his or her student.  The great instructor sets aside a biases and teaches from the heart. He shares his passion for aviation with all who will listen.  He makes the future of aviation, one pilot at a time.

Jason please don&#039;t think I am being too harsh.  I am simply expressing my disappointment in your comments.

Respectfully,

Andrew_Hanson
