		<description><![CDATA[In the past two months, I&#039;ve gone from 3.1 hours to over 46 hours in my log book. I&#039;ve had two CFIs. Your relationship with your CFI is critical. I&#039;m an intelligent guy (as well as an older one) I learned from the first CFI that I needed someone who would really work with me rather than teach at me. My second CFI runs his own flight school and we immediately established a partnership that allowed me to progress at my best rate. This involved an important aspect which was that I needed to be able to speak up when something wasn&#039;t right (either with my performance/understanding or with the presentation). My advice is not to be intimidated by a CFI who lacks patience. You may be the student, but you are also the customer and you will be ultimately responsible. 


 It took me a long time to solo. I could have soloed earlier, as my instructor told me I was fully capable, but he wanted me to get smoother and more confident. I was fine with this. The goal is not just to meet the minimums, but to to be the best pilot you can be.  When I completed my first solo, it really felt like a team effort. 


I have extensive experience training people to use various computer systems and I know that intimidating students is almost guaranteed to create a poor outcome. It&#039;s the mark of a poor instructor or school that makes fun of people for what they don&#039;t know or can&#039;t yet do. 


Regarding the pitfalls, it&#039;s important to remember that it takes fortitude to learn how to fly. Early in my landing practice, I was working as hard as I could and it wasn&#039;t quite coming together. The resulting stress had me in a cold sweat. Later that day, I had a long drive to head back to my home base and I remember thinking that I couldn&#039;t get far enough away from the airplane. The very next day, I had done a complete 180 and couldn&#039;t wait to get back to doing landings. Be strong, think about what your instructor has told you what you need to do and come up with a plan to execute it. That&#039;s a great way to get over the humps.


I eventually got it and, as a result, my first solo was a piece of cake. It was, on the one hand, completely routine. On the other, there was this indescribable joy that I had reached a major milestone.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Through this website we get to know about the
pitfalls come during the pilot training. These pitfalls includes in loss of
confidence, enthusiasm and increased high fly fear. The aviation
training education also offer certification programs on aviation
administration, avionics and electronics. These learning centers for aviation
training make the student recognizable and familiar with the technicalities
required for pilot jobs. For more details on aviation
jobs visit the informative site.

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m sorry to hear how you were treated at the flight school when you landed on the grass. Sounds to me like you were getting ahead of the training curriculum; soft-field landing is usually _after_ you start soloing. I&#039;m getting off track here, I hope you left that flight school after the comment by the flight school owner.

Here&#039;s one thing that I learned during my flight training how to get out of a training pitfall: ask your instructor to send you to another instructor to help you with a skill you&#039;re having a hard time with. This worked for me trying to learn short and soft field landings. Sometimes you simply have to hear the same thing your instructor is trying to tell you from someone else]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jason,

great post, thank you for sharing what was probably a hard time for you. I flew with 16 different instructors (different schools, different places, different ratings...). Working with my primary flight Instructor was really a pleasure. Some others were less pleasant to work with, but only one behaved in an unprofessional way. He was what I call a &quot;jump-in / jump-out&quot; instructor. Almost no time for briefing, and what he called debriefing took place between landing an reaching the parking position.

It is important to have a good match between student pilot and flight instructor. Not all pairs can do well, and it does not mean the student or the instructor is bad. If you don&#039;t feel good with your instructor, try another one. No shame in that.]]></description>
