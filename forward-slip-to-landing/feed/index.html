		<description><![CDATA[Hey jason, I just did my private pilot check ride, and unfortunately i didnt pass, but one of the things the pilot said was not pts was my forward slip to landing.  I entered it at 500ft and performed the maneuver all the way down but exited it about 200ft off the ground due to the fact that if i stayed in the slip I would&#039;ve landed short of the runway, For the maneuver do you have to go all the way to the runway?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jason, would apprciate your comment on why a flight school would insist its Part 61 private pilot applicants must-must complete the long cross country according to the old FAA reg. rather than the more recent FAA requirement of 150 nm. Which do you require of your students ? 

Thanks, and I really value and enjoy your videos and clear advice on all aspects of aviation.

That&#039;s awesome to hear man! Thank you so much! I usually apply them at the same time and evenly. Like you said it&#039;s all about timing.

		<description><![CDATA[Nie,

I almost always opt for the slip. However keep in mind my 150 has 40 degrees of flaps and STOL wing tips so it comes in VERY slow it that config. I&#039;m talking 25mph across the numbers!!!!!

If i&#039;m high I don&#039;t wanna dump in all my flaps and dive.

I&#039;d be more than happy too! I try to keep all the videos short and to the point however i&#039;d be happy to go into more detail in a future video

Smart way to remember it and a good explanation.

Thanks for your comments

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Jason.  My CFI was talking about side slips in cross wind landing at today&#039;s lesson.  I think it would be great ( when you are not on vacation) if you could go into the meat of this video in more detail.  We talked about &quot;cross controlling&quot; which left me a bit confused.  It seemed counter intuitive.  Continuing thanks for your great lessons.

		<description><![CDATA[James,

The aileron and rudder inputs can be made simultaneously or not.  The order of the inputs is not the determining factor for whether it&#039;s called a forward slip or sideslip.

They&#039;re the same maneuver, just used at different times and for different reasons.  Jason&#039;s video does a great job of indicating how you know which slip you&#039;re actually doing.

		<description><![CDATA[Jason,

Real nice video.  I&#039;m awfully happy you stressed an important point; that the two types of slips have no aerodynamic difference!

It&#039;s unfortunate that there are two different names for what is actually the same maneuver.  Despite what we want to call it, they&#039;re both just a slip.

When I was confused which I was doing, I applied a simple test:  Is my longitudinal axis aligned with my ground path (like it would be just before touchdown in order not to sideload the gear)?  That&#039;s a sideslip.  Is my longitudinal axis askew from my ground path?  That&#039;s a forward slip.  This is actually the exact same test you mention in the video, just stated differently (and arguably better for the beginning student!).  Am I looking out the side or front window?

Looking forward to the next video.

		<description><![CDATA[Jason,

I don&#039;t know if this is exactly correct but this is how I usually setup for the two different slips...

1. Sideslip - Start banking into the wind first and then correct with opposite rudder to keep aligned straight. 
2. Forward Slip - Apply full ruder first and then add opposite bank angle to keep aligned straight. 

Basically, it is the timing of what control input to assert first. 

Let me know what you think.
Thanks,
James T

Ps: The how to pass your private pilot checkride book is really helping me prepare for the test. It was a good investment. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Jason, thanks for the video.  Here&#039;s a question:
In those planes where flaps are prohibited or not recommended during a forward slip, what criteria do you use as to whether to slip or just use maximum flaps to loose altitude?

Thanks, Forrest
