		<description><![CDATA[TJ!

You&#039;re that close and haven&#039;t dropped in to say hi yet?!? :)

Ocala just became a Delta not too long ago. But like Lakeland it&#039;s not really too busy. I&#039;ve been to some BUSY Deltas that really need to be Charlies.

Using ATC services (Flight Following) is awesome and a very helpful tool to have in your bag of tricks.

		<description><![CDATA[Bill,

BE SURE! To Read PJ&#039;s comment below as he is more than correct. The guy you talk to on ground is usually the same guy as tower. :) and if not they are sitting next to each other.

This way they can coordinate with other traffic and know what your intentions are well ahead of time.

The last thing PJ said in his comment was the most valuable nugget. Visit the tower or ATC facility if you can. The guys and gals in there are very interesting to talk to. You&#039;ll learn SO much!

		<description><![CDATA[PJ,

DUDE! Awesome comment!

Sounds like you went above and beyond with your radio communications. I love when your AOPA mentor was surprised to find out you had just 9 hours back then!!!

But it&#039;s all because you did exactly what we talk about soooo much on m0a. You learned as much as you can on the ground. Which allowed you to rock it in the air.

Thanks for the tips man! That is such a valuable comment you left! spot on with everything

		<description><![CDATA[I did my primary training in your backyard... (Central FL) ... My primary instructor insisted that I &quot;conquer&quot; radio work early.  At the time, Ocala didn&#039;t have a tower, so we practiced at Lakeland.  Other than Sun N Fun, the rest of the year Lakeland is a very calm place and great place to learn.  In addition, to Class D tower ops, the other natural radio practice is dealing with class B enroute.  As a result partially of this training experience, I now prefer towered airports and try to take advantage of as much of ATC services as I can when enroute! ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[John, that is correct, you are letting ATC know that you have the most up-to-date information.  With an ATIS broadcast, it is not just the weather info that they are worried about, it&#039;s also the NOTAMs they include at the end of the broadcast.  If you are flying into an airport with an ASOS or AWOS instead of ATIS, you just say you &#039;have the information&#039;.  If you do not give them an indication that you have the ATIS/ASOS/AWOS, the controller is required to give you the winds and altimeter.

		<description><![CDATA[Well, telling Ground does a few things:

1) A lot of times at Class D airports that are not busy, Ground and Tower are the same person, so in essence you ARE telling the tower.

2) Whether it&#039;s the same person or not, they are sitting right next to each other, so ground can relay the message to tower.  This helps the tower to know what to expect in advance so that they can make your departure easier.

3) At airports with multiple active runways, telling the ground controller which way you&#039;re going lets them know to sequence you to the runway that gives you the most expeditious departure.  For example, at KDWH, there are parallel runways, 17L/35R and 17R/35L.  Nearly all of the parking is on the east side of the field, so by telling them you&#039;re a west departure, they will guide you to 17R/35L so you can make a quick turn and go.

It&#039;s also for this reason that you should tell tower where you are parking before you land.  That way they can let you land on the runway that will give you the shortest taxi.

BTW - If you are a pilot of any level and have never visited a tower or other ATC facility, do so ASAP.  In my experience, they are always very welcoming and you can learn a lot, especially by visiting the tower at the airport you fly out of regularly.  It takes a little more advance notice and planning to visit a TRACON facility or Class B tower, but I&#039;ve been able to visit a couple of Class D towers recently just by calling them up, telling them that I&#039;m a pilot in the area, and asking if I can come up.  It&#039;s great to see things on the other end of the microphone!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good video, Jason.  I did all of my training at two Class D airports - KDWH (Hooks Airport, Tomball, TX) for the first 6 hours or so, and KSGR (Sugar Land, TX) for the remainder.  In addition to that, when I would travel for business I would go to the local airport and take discovery flights, and all of those were at either Class D (KDVT, KSUS, KENW, KSDM) or Class C (KBIL, KGEG) airports.  So I became very familiar with towered airport communications, and like Chris (are you In the Pattern&#039;s Chris, BTW?), I enjoy talking on the radio almost as much as I enjoy flying.

There are three things that REALLY helped me develop my radio skills:

1) I got a scanner and listened.  Like I said, I used to travel a lot for business, so before a trip I would go print out the airnav pages for the airports I was going to and the taxi diagrams.  I would then listen while waiting for my flight and follow the aircraft progress on the diagram.  I would also go visit the local GA airports, park at the end of the runway, and watch and listen as well.  You get to learn a lot doing that, not just about towered and non-towered communications, but it also helps you learn to identify aircraft types as well.

2) Liveatc.net - While I prefer to be at the airport in person and listening on the scanner, listening to airport traffic on liveatc.net can be educational as well when you can&#039;t get to the airport itself.  Later, when I started doing some training in Houston&#039;s Class B, I would go back and find the liveatc.net recording of myself to critique it.

3) VATSIM and FS9 - Using Microsoft Flight Sim and the VATSIM network (www.vatsim.net), I got to practice radio communications in a practical environment.  VATSIM is free, it just requires FS9, FSX, or XPlane, a headset, and a broadband internet connection.  People go online and act as air traffic controllers and you can go online as a pilot and actually talk back and forth with these people.  It&#039;s very professional and they use real-world ATC rules and procedures.  It&#039;s great practice... and it&#039;s much easier to replace some bent electronics if you mess up here than it is to replace bent aluminum in the real world.

To illustrate my point, I made my very first real-world radio call while on my 2nd or 3rd Discovery Flight, flying into KDVT on Christmas Eve several years ago, with all of 2 hours in my log book.  After I made the call, the instructor told me that she had 100-hr private pilots who couldn&#039;t do it as well as I had.  It works, and it&#039;s cheap!]]></description>

It&#8217;s great practice&#8230; and it&#8217;s much easier to replace some bent electronics if you mess up here than it is to replace bent aluminum in the real world.</p>
<p>To illustrate my point, I made my very first real-world radio call while on my 2nd or 3rd Discovery Flight, flying into KDVT on Christmas Eve several years ago, with all of 2 hours in my log book.  After I made the call, the instructor told me that she had 100-hr private pilots who couldn&#8217;t do it as well as I had.  It works, and it&#8217;s cheap!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Just to clarify, each AITS has an assigned letter, in this case H, &quot;have hotel&quot;.  I suppose it&#039;s to let the tower know you have the latest numbers? I&#039;ll be able to listen to KOUNs ATIS when I get my scanner.  My office is within class delta airspace... Thanks!

		<description><![CDATA[Wow I never knew Deer Valley was the busiest! That had to be tough at first. However radio work at busy airports is really fun once you&#039;ve got it down pat.

		<description><![CDATA[Because I train out of Deer Valley Airport KDVT which is the busiest GA airport in the country, yes even over Van Nuys I have gotten very comfortable on the radio. I am only at about 18 hours but I enjoy the radio work as much as the flying.

Cheers,
Chris]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[haha great comment Ben!

I never thought of it as someone grading your landing from the tower :) I&#039;m sure they peak every now and then just to see.

		<description><![CDATA[My class delta airspace communications have always been pretty good.  The operators of those towers tend to be pretty laid back and just glad they have someone to talk to.  I&#039;ve landed at MIE, DEC and LAF.  

My first class delta experience was at MIE.  I had to ask for clarification on whether or not I was cleared to land, but I was most nervous about having a good landing because I knew someone was watching. ha
