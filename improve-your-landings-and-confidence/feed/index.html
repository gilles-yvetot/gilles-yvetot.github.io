		<description><![CDATA[Slow flight just above a stall is fine, but throw in a turn and don&#039;t you create the possibility of going into a spin if you mess up a little?  I own a Grumman Cheetah and spins are prohibited, so it&#039;s always been a fear of mine to tempt a spin.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jason,
I am learning to fly a Bellanca Super Viking, and while it is super sweet in the air, pattern work is more difficult than expected. I started out by going to the practice area, and shooting &#039;approaches and landings&#039; at 1000&#039;AGL with a &#039;pattern&#039; altitude of  1800&#039;AGL. It really helped to start getting a handle of the power and speed in the air before I got back to the airport. This plane has 300 hp and we approach at 90, which you would not think all that different from the 172&#039;s 75-80, but it makes a ton of difference. throw a variable pitch prop and landing gear in there and things get hopping fast. I learned complex years ago in a c172RG but this is far and away not the same thing. It will dance on the runway both on takeoff and landing so you have to be really alert. Keeping straight on the runway once down and while on take off roll is the hardest part. I thought take -off would be simple right? Put the gas to it and go. Oh no no. I have an instructor helping me master the plane, and it looks like it will take at least 5 hours, but with 2 under my belt, I am seeing definite improvements, and I can see that this can be done. The first time I wasn&#039;t so sure. Whenever I don&#039;t feel right, we go and do some MCA and practice in the practice area.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jason,
I&#039;m enjoying your sessions very much. I&#039;m not an instructor of any kind but am a fan of your &quot;build on the last lesson&quot; technique. I remember my very first lesson some years ago at a soft field in Massachussetts. Trying to drive a C 150 around a cow pasture was at first impossible for me, but the first step to getting to the &quot;runway&quot;. 

Your coined phrase &quot;A good pilot is always learning&quot; is what flying is all about, a continuing education. I don&#039;t know one airplane driver who isn&#039;t challenged on most any flight, learning something new, spurred to ask questions of a colleague,  even reinventing a maneuver while keeping it fun, I call it painless learning. ]]></description>
