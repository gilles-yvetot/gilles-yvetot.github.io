		<description><![CDATA[Marcel!

You&#039;re correct! Normally the right steep turn is the tougher way to go haha glad you got it though.

I&#039;ll for sure be adding this to the book today!

		<description><![CDATA[During my training my instructor tought me to keep the right altitude, bank angle and position during steep turns. Funny thing is that my right steep turn is better then my left.

At my skills test the examiner asked me to do a steep turn. After i finished it i didn&#039;t loose a foot and i even felt my own wake turbulence. I was very happy with the result, but the examiner wasn&#039;t so much. Why? I lost some speed along the way!

During all my training i was never thought to look at the speed indicator. Lesson learned!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great Aaron!

You after all are the PIC! You&#039;ve been trained for each maneuver. If the DPE asks for something beyond that he&#039;s most likely over reaching anyways.

Longer answer to follow in the book

		<description><![CDATA[What?!?

Check the fuses? First off that sounds like the easy way out as you said...

Secondly the last thing i&#039;d be doing in the situation is checking the fuses or breakers.

FLY THE AIRPLANE!

Sounds like a silly question.

I like your insight Mike and how you didn&#039;t want to take the easy way out!

		<description><![CDATA[You know what I love about you Joe? You always call me Captain even though you know i&#039;m the captain of a 150! :)

But it&#039;s a C-150 might I add....20 times bigger then a C-130 if you&#039;re looking at it like that :)

cracking myself up ! :)

ok serious now...

They don&#039;t mess around anymore. You could get away with that a while back but not much anymore

Great points

		<description><![CDATA[My instructor grilled me on using ALL available options. When flying on a cross country, he started asking me question after question, then turned off the gps. Then went on with more questions which got me a bit confused, since I was looking at the sectional too much(he was teaching me to keep most of my attention outside the plane). He then wanted me to land at the airport which I was having trouble finding. &quot;What can you do&quot;, he asked? Who can help you? Where is the airport, and how can you get there?

The answer ... call up your airports tower and ask for a heading to the airport was the answer. And man, the folks in the tower are great! He guided me in and told me to land on runway two ninner ... the short one on the left. 

Another thing that I thought might have helped is a regular automotive road map. It&#039;s amazing how much you can see from the air and identify on the map.  Also, google maps or the like can be printed out and taken with you. I&#039;ve flown my cross county via google maps to see if my way points are visible.

Lastly, if your watch konks out, you can use your cell phone as a backup for a timer. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[myself, I teach every student the 3-2-1 rule. Its easy, you  end up at tpa exactly if you use this formula. you take your altitude and subtract it from the tpa, exampe youre at 5,000 feet and tpa is 1,000. thats 4,000 feet you have to descend. you divide your ground speed by 2 and add a zero (ex 100kts is 500) that gives you your fpm rate of descent to maintain a 1,000 ft descent for every 3 sm. and you start that descent at 12 miles since that is 3 x the change in altitude, in this case being 4. works like a charm!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll give you an abbreviated answer here and a great one inside the book!

A stable approach starts on the downwind! Perfect landings start in the pattern.

Remember you trim for airspeed so the trim really depends on the situation. If you&#039;re flying a great approach and proper glidepath a little nose down trim will be needed.

		<description><![CDATA[I always thought this question was funny, but the DE always used it apparently.  I didn&#039;t like the &#039;easy&#039; answer which I was urged to just give in order to get by it.

Q: &#039;You are on short final with full flaps out, and another aircraft takes the runway under you.  You attempt to climb and retract the flaps but they don&#039;t budge.  You can&#039;t gain altitude.  What do you do.&#039;
A: &#039;Check the fuses.&#039;

All kinds of other things went on in my mind.  I definitely wanted to go further into the &#039;then what&#039;.  Land on a taxiway?  Grass?  Whatever it takes really.  If you can&#039;t gain altitude you might not want to pass the airport by unless you can maintain altitude and you have some left to make an abbreviated pattern.  At least that was my feeling on it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Didn&#039;t the FAA say recently that they were going to be adding thousands of questions to the various pools the testing people use?

That kind of scares me from a student perspective.  In the past it was difficult, but it was possible to hit every question on the private a few times.  And that was helpful to me, especially since most the questions have the right answer and the &#039;almost right&#039; answer.  The latter being for people who know what they should do to answer it, but are not experienced enough to see through the trick.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I can ditto this.  I have a tendency to descend and slow too early, when I eyeball it.  I guess if I was really worried about it I would pick a &#039;normal&#039; decent rate and calculate how far from the destination I would need to descend to TPA.

But my eyeball isn&#039;t experienced enough yet to just wing it.  Hah a pun.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Capt. Jason. You probably have run into using deviating lingo to the Ground or Tower. I was written up for using a deviating question after advisory about traffic in the pattern and on approach. I said:  Is that a Stealth Cessna? ( The report stayed in the local tower, but, it can get scary, when you happen to read your comments after wards). Just a little hint for your students.
                                                          Fly straight and level and a clear mind.             Joe.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While in training, we don&#039;t often have opportunity for practice using the E6B or performance charts.  Are there sources of practice questions or scenarios in which to gain more practical experience, so that the confidence while flying would be more fluid vs. frenzied.

		<description><![CDATA[Jake,

Nothing is better then making a smart decision! No I don&#039;t deal with landing on ice too much :) but your story transcends to SOOO many other aspects of flying.

I&#039;ll be using your story in the private pilot blueprint
