		<description><![CDATA[I encountered the unexpected on my checkride regarding unusual attitude flying.  I had just completed the basic instrument maneuvers while wearing the IFR training glasses.  The DPE (Designated Pilot Examiner) said to close my eyes and she would be checking that they were closed.  Next, the DPE said to start making turns and changes in pitch to prepare for recovery from an unusual flight attitude.

I was surprised by this request since instructors have always have always had me put my head down and they had their rare chance to actually fly the plane.  Flying with my eyes closed to deliberately put the plane in an unusual attitude after basic instrument maneuvers enforced that I need to consider cues from the airplane such as the sound of the wind related to airspeed.  After 20 seconds or so, the DPE told me to open my eyes and recover.

The entire setup and recovery was valuable to me since I was flying the plane with no ground or instrument references.  The DPE was excellent, not only because I passed the practical test, and helped me consider more options once I received my Private Pilot Certificate.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great thoughts.  I have students that shy away from these too.  But they are essential.  I&#039;d suggest also that I really like for my students to be very proficient at Xwind take-off and landings.  The windsock can give us a lot of anxiety when it is horizontal to the ground and perpendicular to the runway!
