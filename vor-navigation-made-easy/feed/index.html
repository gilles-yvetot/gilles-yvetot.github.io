		<description><![CDATA[Jason, this is a fantastic tutorial. Thank you!

Question, can you share what is the software or app you are using on this demo?  I would like to use that for practice. 

Many thanks and very glad to find you. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, the initial objective was to fly to the VOR on a heading of 090. Although as I originally commented, that&#039;s not a good real-world example, if you wanted to fly to the station, most likely you&#039;d tune the station, determine the most direct route, and fly that heading - in the video, I&#039;d guess that to be about 030 from the initial position, which would make you inbound on the 210 radial, but you&#039;d still set the OBS to 030, as that&#039;s the heading you want to fly to the station, and by selecting that bearing all you have to do is fly toward the needle to return to course if you get off.  I&#039;m not saying your method is wrong, just for those who may not be as familiar w/VOR nav, they need to be aware of the behavior of the indicator needle as it relates to where you are and where you set the OBS. To go back to the 270/090 scenario - you are west of the VOR and want to fly toward it on a heading of 090. If you set the OBS to 270 the needle will indicate to the right, but you must fly to the left to intercept the course. If you set the OBS to 090, the needle will indicate to the left and you must fly to the left - much easier for me, especially under the hood, in actual IMC, or at night, which is when I primarily use VOR nav - fly toward the needle. The nav system makes the calculations for you - it knows that the radial is actually the 270/090 radial, depending on your direction of travel, and east of the VOR, it&#039;s the 090/270 radial. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Absolutely right - IF I was attempting to fly 060° I would follow your directions.  But I specifically said I&#039;d fly 360° to intercept the 270° FROM radial.

I think we&#039;re both looking at the correct answers for our given situations.  If I&#039;m still wrong, let me know.  Thanks for the clarification.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tracy,

You do not want to select the 270 radial to fly to the station if you&#039;re west of the VOR. Doing so would result in exactly what you don&#039;t want - a &quot;reverse&quot; situation. In the example, if you set the OBS to 270 and flew the 360 to intercept, as you turned to 060 or whatever to intercept the 090 course, the needle would be to the right and if you &quot;chased&quot; the needle as you should when using a VOR, it would lead you off course to the south. By selecting 090, as you turn to 060, the needle will indicate to the left and will gradually center as you approach the proper course to the station, keeping you flying on a NE heading which you&#039;d gradually shallow to 090 as the needle showed you were approaching your course. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Joe:

I agree with you completely.  Here&#039;s my question: I have NEVER heard of any reference to a &#039;bearing&#039; when dealing with VOR navigation; that term is reserved to ADF navigation.  Does anyone remember MH + RB = MB ?  This formula refers to headings &#038; BEARINGS!  OK, I know the device we twist on the VOR is the OmniBEARING Selector, but we fly headings to and from radials......

Sounds to me in this lesson the task was supposed to fly a 360° HEADING to the 270° RADIAL, turn to intercept the station, and then fly outbound on the 090° RADIAL.

And if my interpretation is correct, the OBS should have been set to the 270° radial FROM the station and then, once intercepting the radial, reset to 90° TO the station.  My rule is you ALWAYS have the OBS set FROM the station unless you are flying directly TO the station - this lessens the possibilities of being in a &#039;reverse sensing&#039; situation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jason.
First let me say I like your stuff, but this lesson isn&#039;t right.  The task you set was to&quot;intercept and track the 090 radial to the station.&quot;   What you demonstrated was &quot;intercept and track the 270 radial to the station.&quot;  You flew a course of 090 to the station but that wasn&#039;t the task.  The 090 radial exists only to the east of the station, to execute the set task this radial must be intercepted east of the station and then flown inbound on a course of 270.

Best regards

Joe Platt]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jason, sorry you&#039;re not feeling well. Wish I&#039;d seen this before I spent so many hours trying to wrap my head around it. One small thing, it would be unusual for an examiner to ask you to fly to a VOR on any but the most direct radial - but they very well might ask you to set up the NAV radio for a course to an airport or a checkpoint, as my instructor has done several times. Lay the plotter from the VOR to the destination, read the radial, use the VOR to determine your current position, and intercept the course. One other note, the VOR signal is only reliable to about 50nm from the VOR.]]></description>

Thanks for the kind words!

I&#039;ll see if I can edit a new version of the video to include how I did it.

		<description><![CDATA[Carlos,

You don&#039;t want to fall into a trap with saying &quot;follow the needle&quot; some students try that and end up doing 360&#039;s and wondering where the course is.

You need find out where you are in relation to the VOR then setup an Intercept towards the needle and hold it.
