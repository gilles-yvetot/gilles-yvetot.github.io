		<description><![CDATA[My condolences also. It breaks my heart to see this. So many planes destroyed and damaged. I bought a wrecked plane and spent about 400 hrs. rebuilding it, just to have it destroyed by a buck deer 10 yrs later. I can only imagine the pain and heartbreak at sun-n fun right now. Y&#039;all are in our prayers.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My condolences .  I remember the twister that hit KOPF back in 1998 and Hurricane Wilma back in 2005, the second one causing over $27K in damages to my airplane.  Those planes that appear to be intact may have control surface damage so there is more than meet the eye hen it comes to wind damage.  Good luck all.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Howard in Zephyrhills,FL -about 30 miles NW of Sun-N-Fun.
Very sad to see the damage , but glad to hear so little injuries. 
 I was up since 5am following the whole line of storms , even in the line of the cell preceding the one that hit Lakeland,FL. Weather forecasts and reports were actually very good at predicting the possibility of severe storms Thursday morning.  
The squall line that pushed through the area was something we see hear once or twice every 10 years . We are very fortunate . This was the kind of weather system that often spawns major killer tornadoes and all one can do is hunker down amd take cover.
 Unfortunately , with the size Sun-N-Fun has grown too, if you had enough hanger space, there&#039;d be no space left for the show and all its aspects. Just need to remember ,especially as aviation enthusiasts , we all know how weather can throw us curve balls. Sometimes very extreme curveballs. 
 Hope to be there Sat. or Sun. ,but may take my 8yr old daughter to Kermit Weeks place for his Mustang-Mustang event . Just love the sound of those Merlins .]]></description>
