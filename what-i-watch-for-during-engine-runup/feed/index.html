		<description><![CDATA[Nice video Jason!  I pretty much do exactly as you do in the video with one exception:  I leave the carb heat on when I throttle back to idle.  This is  because that is what the configuration will be when I am below 2000 RPM in the pattern and especially when I cut the throttle on flare.  Up here in Maine carb heat is our best friend (particularly from autumn to spring).  I would like to know whether the engine is going to cut out on me when I have pulled the throttle to idle during landing, especially if for some reason I need to apply power and/or do a go around.  I figure it is better to have the engine die while solidly on the ground rather than during the landing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For sure!! I like that idea!


However It does remind me of that story when a student pilot right before takeoff switched takes and had the engine fail on takeoff.

I like your idea of taxi on one.... then switch...runup and leave it on that tank. As you know it works

		<description><![CDATA[An instructor of mine had a good recommendation years ago that I always follow now.  I turn the fuel selector switch to the lower of my tanks on initial starting.  I then run on that tank while taxiing from the parking/tie down area to the run up area.  Then when I begin my run up I switch to the other tank (fullest), finish the run up and take off with this tank.  This insures you&#039;ve run the engine from fuel in both tanks before take off.  Good idea in case you have water or bad gas in a tank.]]></description>

I only have about 8 hrs of instruction so far and plan to continuing through private pilot, instrument rating then on to my twin engine rating!! This video helps to keep things fresh and provides a good reference!  My instructor and I do everything you mentioned plus circuit breaker checks.]]></description>

Your comment is genius! If every pilot followed these steps and watched for the few things you mentioned accident rates would continue to drop!


It&#039;s all about having a system/flow

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Russ!

I think you&#039;re spot on and thats a super smart decision. It&#039;s another great way to keep thinking ahead of that airplane!



Hope you and the ole&#039; Challenger are doing well :)


See ya at Sun n Fun or maybe Oshkosh this year :)

		<description><![CDATA[Here is my routine for all airplanes especially the Cessna 152. 1) circuit breakers in. I have caught a couple of times that one circuit breaker popped out during taxi. 2) I always point the plane into the wind for max cooling for the runup. 3)For controls I do &quot;thumb up aileron up&quot; If you turn the yoke to the right for instance your top hand thumb will point to the up aileron. A little silly but it works. 4) as stated below when the carb heat comes out, look for a drop then the throttle goes to idle. The same as in the transition to landing setting.5) Lights, Camera, Action. Landing light on within 10 miles of the airport for other airplanes to see me. Camera - transponder on ALT and 1200. Just to make sure the students are paying attention I will change one of the zero&#039;s to a 2 to see if they are paying attention. I had DPE&#039;s try this on checkrides for me and I have caught it everytime. 6) My passenger briefing is ABCCDE A- AIRPLANES all passengers and pilot looking for aircraft, B- Belts how to get in and out of the seatbelts, C - do not touch the CONTROLS unless I say too. C - sterile COCKPIT for the first 5 minutes until out of the traffic area, D - doors

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think it&#039;s so much of the run-up as it is a final check before takeoff, but I like to review the chart and notes one more time to memorize what runway number I&#039;m planning to land on at the next airport and to check and make sure my radio has the proper frequency at the next airport in there so all I have to do is quickly switch over to it. That way, I&#039;m not distracted from flying the plane enroute. Hope you&#039;re doing well Jason! Maybe I&#039;ll see you again at Sun N&#039; Fun next year.]]></description>

Great point

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Tom!

Placing the aircraft into the wind is ALWAYS a good idea.

However I&#039;m not a big fan of what you&#039;re calling a &quot;deadcut&quot; or what some others might call a &quot;Mag ground check&quot;



AOPA did an article a few years bag (will try to find it) On how a ground check can actual cause more damage than good to your engine in the long term...


I&#039;ll dig that up and get back with you

		<description><![CDATA[A couple added tips that I&#039;ll add:

- When checking mags, do the right one (2 clicks over) first, then finish with the left for on click back to both.  You&#039;ll NEVER end up taking off on one mag accidentally (done that!)

- Checking carb heat, let it sit for maybe 10 seconds.  It can take some time for ice to melt, a brief check may not be long enough. (at least here in soggy, cool Seattle!).

Great videos!

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Jason,  great video. One tip I was taught during run-up and the carb heat,  leave the carb heat on while pulling throttle all the way to idle and ensure the engine remains running, simulating a landing scenario.  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jason, thanks so much for your review of this procedure.  I&#039;m early hours-ish and appreciate the opportunity to reinforce this vital pre-takeoff phase.  LSP]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Jason, 

would love your opinion on some of the things I do on my run up in a 152. 

Firstly, I position the aircraft into wind at the holding point, to cool the engine. 

Another thing I&#039;ve seen and had some instructors suggest is try the deadcut all the way to the left with the keys, to check that the engine really does quit, and cannot be started by turning the prop. This in order to protect the ground crew?]]></description>
