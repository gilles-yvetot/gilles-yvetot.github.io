		<description><![CDATA[Jason, I enjoy receiving and reading your GA info. Very current and insightful. I&#039;m a student pilot with 10 hrs logged while attending grad school in CO. Learning to fly amongst the 14ers was a great experience and I believe an attribute toward my training and skills I developed. Ironically, I&#039;m now out of school and employed in an unrelated field and am finding it difficult to fund the remainder of training required for my PPC (VFR). I live in Long Island, NY and found what appears to be a good school (141 Rated) nearby. Any suggestions on where I can find help funding the accomplishment of my dream to be a pilot? MDW, Long Beach, NY]]></description>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey Mike,</p>
<p>172&#39;s are frequent trainers.</p>
<p>Things to look for</p>
<p>-Low Total time airframe (TTAF) under say 4,000 is a gem but don&#39;t overlook the 5-6 thousand range</p>
<p>-Low overhaul time (SMOH) Most 172&#39;s have a lycoming 0-320 and the overhaul &#8220;max suggestion time&#8221; is 2000 hours. Look for something midlife or less.</p>
<p>-IFR avionics. DO you wish to get you instrument one day? This will save a ton of money and stress having them installed already.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a ton more email me and keep me up to date on your progress.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Ira,

Great question!

In 1971 Cessna introduced the 172L. The biggest change in this was the landing gear from a flat tapered steel spring (no camber) to tubular landing gear.
