		<description><![CDATA[Great as usual Jason.   Funny that you mentioned about not seeing standard conditions - Just yesterday I was flying at Van Nuys CA, and barometer was 29.92 with airport temp  at 13 c (804 ft MSL - so I assume ~15c at sea leavel) and I was thinking to myself  this must be exactly a standard day.  :-)  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jason, it&#039;s Gilberto here. Thanks for the answer, I think I understand it much better now. So basically what I need is to have a table to convert IAS to TAS, right (as to take into consideration the deviations from the standard conditions)? Thanks a lot for the video and take care.]]></description>
