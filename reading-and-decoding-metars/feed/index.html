		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jason,

I just found your site tonight and I like what you have done, I have watched all of your podcast that came up when the page opened. How do I find all of your podcast? I have clicked all podcast links that I have seen but i can only see the 4 or 5 one the one page.
You mentioned your reading metars podcast. I would like to see them all, like i said what i have seen are very well put together.

Thanks in Advance,
