		<description><![CDATA[Another awesome and relavent video, Jason!  You know what? I&#039;m a pretty high-time pilot, but I fly a low-level helicopter.  Believe it or not, when we have a flight to a destination we haven&#039;t been to before, I still draw a line on a map with a highlighter.  I look for any airports I might fly over, prominent landmarks, SUA, or other features (e.g. really tall antennas!) that might interfere with my flight.  I don&#039;t make 10-mile tick-marks anymore, but I do measure the distance and mark the halfway point.   (Plus, it&#039;s fun to see what stuff I&#039;m going to fly over!)  My advice: Use BIG landmarks, not little ones that may be hard to see from altitude.

It would be very easy...too easy, actually to just rely on the GPS to do this flight planning for me.  But I don&#039;t like surprises.  My idea of a perfect flight is one in which everything went &quot;pretty much&quot; according to plan and I didn&#039;t have any surprises of the bad kind.

Lay the charts out, then draw the line.  Even some of us pros still do it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Charles!

Wonderful! I hope when you&#039;re ready you&#039;ll choose to take my Online Ground School you&#039;ll REALLY be impressed.

Michael was correct below I was just abbreviating my altitude 18 (1,800) for (climbing to) 25 (2,500) 

Now i&#039;ve be ridiculed by other pilots for saying this!!!! They said &quot;Well 18 could mean 18,000 as well&quot;

haha it cracks me up when people say that because i&#039;m in a Cessna 150 ;)

Awesome! I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll get those landings figured out you can&#039;t be too far away from soloing!

Enjoy your dual cross country and let me know how it goes

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Jason. Love your videos. Aviation still a dream for me at this point but learning what I can while I save for the ground school.

Question please. Your radio call. After you say 6 miles NW of the airport you say &quot;18 for 25 VFR fligfht following across city&quot;. What does 18 for 25 mean?

Thanks,

Charles.

		<description><![CDATA[Michael I can relate, fuel burn is something that I have struggled with time to time. I have flown multiple single engines, and no matter what the poh says, it seems I&#039;m always paying for more fuel than calculated. I chalk this up to older engines burning more fuel. But the good news is that if you plan enough reserve, you shouldn&#039;t get into trouble! But i feel your pain and maybe we can get Jason to comment and ease our fears!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I guess I didn&#039;t talk about planning too much.  For some reason to this day I don&#039;t know how to really figure out climb out fuel burn like I should.The Cessna chart lists alts, so I take 1000 (thats our alt MSL) and subtract it from where ever I am heading to.  For instance if (I don&#039;t have the chart in front of me) it says that 4000 is something like 10 min, 5 nm, and .7 gallons, and it says that 1000 is 2 min, .5 nm and .2 gallons, I would plan for 8 min, 4.5 nm, and .5 gallons.  Dipping tanks doesn&#039;t seem to suggest I am doing it right though.  Distance and time seem to match pretty good.I think I once planned where I took the above and added it to the normal cruse fuel burn, and taxi burn and that was closer, but that seems wrong.I guess when it boils down to it, I just don&#039;t trust my fuel planning and I&#039;m always nervous about it.  Even when I have tons of reserve.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Michael,

You&#039;re very correct, cross countries build so much confidence. Even though new airports can be difficult.

Your last point really made me smile. Because I know it doesn&#039;t just happen to me and my students now. Hearing someone say 5 miles SW at 2,500 ft and you&#039;re going uhhhh I&#039;m 5 miles SW at 2,500!

That&#039;s scary and makes you turn your head real quick!

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll be generic, but any xcountry I did with an instructor went smooth as silk.  I guess I was pretty lazy and just kind of eyeballed checkpoint times to make sure I wasn&#039;t getting too far off my estimates, but for the most part pilotage was easy enough.Pilotage was especially easy at night any time I have flown night xcountries.  You can make out those faint beacons for like 40 nm around here hah!Any solo xcountry I have done has had some character though.  Both of my training cross countries just suffered from being way to high on final.  Something about being weirded out by a new field and not having a CFI hounding me to cut power more.  In any of those cases, I salvaged the landing no sweat, it was just something I noticed.In one xcountry I took after getting my licence I had to work out some weird traffic situation.  I was listening to the frequency about 20 miles out, and some guy reported heading to the same field at the same position.  I could never see him until he was maneuvering for a base.  Scared me.  I was to the point where I was going to do a 360 south of the field until I could figure out where the heck he was.  In the end it pretty much worked out, just follow him in.  (He did have to back taxi and I had to go around, but meh)That&#039;s one thing I like about getting exposed to weird new situations.  Partially the confidence boost when I realize I worked it out, second the experience building by being in a situation that is new to me.]]></description>
