		<description><![CDATA[I always make sure I have a small headlamp in my flight bag. I keep it in the same pocket that my headset is in. I like headlamps better than flashlights because I can use it hands-free. It is useful when pre-flighting and fueling after dark. Also, I have used it in flight at night to read charts or instruments, especially in older airplanes that have poor cockpit lighting. I would also add an E6B or electronic flight computer, and definitely two pens to write with. Never know when one of them will run out of ink or otherwise quit working.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I find a tri-fold kneeboard with the VFR plaque, sectional chart, checkmate checklist, and pad of paper works fine.  The chart and checklist are easy to read, and it is convient to write down ATIS information.

I believe it&#039;s also important for all pilots to have
1. POH of the plane they fly in
2. E6-B flight computer (manual slide rule kind), and
3. current charts, A/FD, approach plates etc as required]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jason, another great video. I really like your approach to teaching. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Someone mentioned spare sunglasses. I learned not too long ago, your spare sunglasses should be in a hard case, so they&#039;re actually usable when you need them. It also doesn&#039;t hurt to have a hard case along to pop your primary pair into when you take them off, once they end up on the cockpit floor and stepped on, they don&#039;t work too well.  One other thing I&#039;d suggest is a few $20 bills, maybe $100 - $200. You could find yourself in need of supplies, parts, transportation, or food, and unable to pay by credit card at some small airports.]]></description>

My favorite thing you mentioned is number 3 &quot;The 3rd hand chart holder&quot; because I know opening a sectional chart IS A PAIN! and we all know that trying to fold them back how you bought them is even worse!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This goes double for inside my little 150 cockpit :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jason]]></description>
