		<description><![CDATA[Part 141 seems more organized and academic but I much prefer part 61 because you get straight to the point and you can focus more on your improvement in flying. In part 141 you have to do everything but the lesson until you can finally fly your lesson! -Chris]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[i too have done both in Sugar Land, TX. I really think I prefer the part 61 now. I like the structure of the part 141 but I also enjoy the &quot;get at it&quot; instruction of the part 61. I will be starting back up soon and this time I will be private....I promise! And I will join your ground school this time Jason. 
thanks

		<description><![CDATA[Oscar! You&#039;re very correct!

Part 141 is very &quot;academic&quot; in fact if you go to an aviation college you&#039;ll typically fly 141

		<description><![CDATA[Where I live, &quot;part 141&quot; is the more usual, although it&#039;s not specially called &quot;part141&quot; since it&#039;s not the USA, but it&#039;s the kind of flight school I went to. I like this because there is a particular resemblance to academic instruction, which for me works, although a more relaxed environment will do me a great benefit specially because I want to get a sailplane certification on my license.  Keep up the good work.]]></description>
