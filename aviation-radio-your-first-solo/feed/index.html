		<description><![CDATA[I got my paper work this week,and today I did my first SOLO!!!!  My instructor flew a few laps around the pattern with me and I knew he had another student soon after me,so I really didn`t think we had time today,but we landed and he told me to let him out and do the same thing without him!! So I didn`t have much time to get nervous,but to stay focussed and if things didn`t look quite right to go around. I think the three landings were my best yet,I surprised myself!!! WOW what a feeling of accomplishment !! Gook luck and safe flying to all............Ed]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Congrats !!  Like you said the approach  and your being on your numbers is very important. I hate to say but I didn`t get to solo,I didn`t have the proper paper work to be signed,a misunderstanding between myself and the flight school. So I flew with my instructor on a shorter runway that I only used a few times prior,so it was time well spent getting more practice on that runway. Now I`m hoping maybe next week?&lt;br&gt;Good luck with your flying,fly safe and happy landings to you!!!...........Ed]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What a coincidence, I flew my first solo this morning as well!  I did four full-stop landings.  I was pretty nervous on my first two landings and my base and final honestly were pretty bad - I had to use 40 degrees flaps on the first one since I came in too high, and I agree completely, it felt like the Cessna 150 turned into a giant parachute.  I also tended to gain quite a bit of altitude in the pattern without the instructor, but I adjusted and it went fine.  The last two landings were nice and soft.  I&#039;ve found on landings, the approach is just as important as the roundout and flare.  A bad base leg and final tend to throw off the rest of the landing due to the increased number of variables that have to be monitored and corrected.  All in all it was a lot of fun and I&#039;m looking forward to now building up solo hours and moving onto cross country flights!]]></description>
