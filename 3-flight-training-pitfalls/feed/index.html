		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for providing information about the flight pitfalls. I was unaware about the flight pitfalls; but after reading the above article now I understand about the various pitfalls comes  in a pilot training program. The information you have described in flight , instructor and financial pitfalls is very useful for those apprentices who are going to take admission in an aviation academy.

<p>Too many students focus on &#8220;memorizing&#8221; their written test questions. Which in the long run doesn&#39;t really help them at all.</p>
<p>Taking the question and applying it to a real life situation will do wonders for a budding student.</p>
<p>How did you handle your students ground work? Did you give them &#8220;homework&#8221; or more formal ground school?</p>

		<description><![CDATA[John,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You hit the nail on the head&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good instructors are a gem!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I try not to classify anyone as a &quot;problem student&quot; like your fellow instructors did. You&#039;re exactly right it&#039;s a challenge but totally worth it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I find the biggest &quot;problem&quot; is getting them to put their nose in a book :) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Jason]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jason:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When I was active as a flight instructor I always seemed to get what other instructors called &quot;problem students&quot;, but I really enjoyed the challenge. Perhaps that was because by the time I became a flight instructor I had a fair bit of flying time and was flying for a living at an FBO.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finding and keeping a good instructor is important, but unfortunately too many cfis are just trying to build time. Its a shame they don&#039;t feel responsible to finish their students before they move on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;JetAviator7 (John ATP)&lt;br&gt;Entrepreneur and Internet Publisher&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://all-things-aviation.com/featured/original-aviator-sunglasses&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://all-things-aviation.com/featured/origina...&lt;/a&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Nothing is worse than always changing instructors&quot; except when you have a bad one and you want to switch to a new, better one. I think that it&#039;s a huge mistake to struggle through training with someone you don&#039;t like, don&#039;t respect or simply don&#039;t gel with. On the other hand, if you find a good instructor, cling on for dear life. They&#039;re rarer than hen&#039;s teeth.]]></description>
