		<description><![CDATA[Jason, great video!  But all pilots should know that if the FAA really wants to get picky, they can ask deeper questions about airworthiness.   All certified aircraft must have some sort of periodic inspection (e.g. Annual).  Aircraft used commercially (like flight school aircraft) must also have 100-hour inspections.  If an FAA inspector wanted to get...umm...&quot;snippy,&quot; he could legitimately ask for the pilot to produce evidence that the Annual is not overdue.  (Helicopters have more extensive requirements in that they have certain limited-life components that may not be overflown - as an engine or other component&#039;s recommended overhaul interval can. )  If there is ANY question of an aircraft&#039;s airworthiness, the FAA can ground it on the spot.   Might not be really convenient if you&#039;re in the middle of a long cross-country.

By the way, an over-the-counter POH *can* be acceptible AS LONG AS  it is the most current one provided by the a/c manufacturer, and that a current equipment list and weight and balance is in the airplane.

The key is to not make the FAA dig deeeper - not give them any reason.  If you get &quot;ramped&quot; and can immediately produce your personal certs (I keep mine in a dedicated pouch so they&#039;re always together and protected from wear/tear), and can immediately produce the reg, a/w cert, AFM and weight and balance, then the Fed will know you have your act together.  Hopefully he&#039;ll move on to someone else.  However, if you stumble around, don&#039;t know what&#039;s required to be in the plane and can&#039;t find what is in there, the Fed will have a legitimate reason to probe further.

Your video and the information in it is vitally important to ALL pilots.   Thanks for putting it up!]]></description>
