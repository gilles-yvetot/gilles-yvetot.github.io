		<description><![CDATA[Jeremy,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You&#039;re correct a lot of people don&#039;t advise when leaving airspace. This instance happened to me just the other day. Departed a Class Delta airport made my turn out and the controller just forgot to say &quot;see ya&quot; or &quot;contact approach on XXX.xx if you want advisories.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Simply workload permitting. I usually take the time to say, &quot;thank you for your help&quot; just to be kind to them and notify that I&#039;m leaving their airspace.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jason]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It went well - ATC comms are one of those things I seem to retain even when I haven&#039;t done too much talking recently. Aside from calling myself 24L instead of 14L when cleared to land, it was all smooth. Plus ATC was a major factor with a traffic alert when receiving VFR Advisories.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There will be video on my blog shortly from both legs of the trip (traffic close call is in the second video) with the comms if you want to make a full critique! ;-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree - good video.  In Class D procedures in the US, do you need to advise the tower when you&#039;re leaving the control area and changing to the area frequency (assuming you&#039;re going into class G without flight following)?  Here in Australia we have recently switched to Class D (from a previous unique system called GAAP), and although the documents explaining the changes specifically say you don&#039;t have to notify tower after departure (the last exchange with the tower is the takeoff or touch and go clearance), it seems a lot of people are doing this anyway.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Steve, &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That&#039;s Great! Keep me posted on how it goes. Review your procedures and be ready for anything. Always remember controllers are forgiving people and don&#039;t expect you to be perfect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jason]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the post - I&#039;m going into a Delta on Saturday for the first time in a while so you had perfect timing on this! It&#039;s always great to review ATC procedures when you&#039;ve been flying only at uncontrolled airspace.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;ve got that right! Radios can be tough! There are so many different possibilities and equations that go into it. Which really makes each communication unique.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#039;m glad you enjoyed the video, trying to show some &quot;real flying&quot; as compared to &quot;what flying should look like&quot; :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jason]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Pretty cool.  Radio communication is nerve-wracking for many student pilots (like myself!).  It&#039;s a nice change to see a video that&#039;s less rigidly instructional and more just a video of what happens in the cockpit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks!]]></description>
