<p>TEXT TRANSCRIPT:</p>
<p><a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/inflightemergencies.com/');"  href="http://inflightemergencies.com/"><img src="../wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Inflight_Emergencies_Cover_for_Kindle-187x300.jpg" alt="Inflight Emergency" width="187" height="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4010" /></a>Today, we are talking about handling inflight Emergencies. This is the presentation I’ve done literally all over the country. Some of you have the flyers about the Aviation Seminar at Sea, you see I’ve done it there, Sun n Fun, Oshkosh, AOPA Aviation Summit, really a highly sought that after presentation, I am very fortunate and excited to share with you guys. So you may be asking yourself, who is this Jason guy? anybody here ever heard of a website called MzeroA.com, maybe you&#8217;ve seen the videos. I run a flight training video blog called MzeroA.com, we were the first people that actually externally mount cameras on general aviation aircraft for the purpose of flight training. So just like the video clip you saw at the very beginning. We are taking flight training to a new level educating people through social media and be on facebook, twitter &#038; Youtube with those videos. Having the number one rated online ground school that also lead to over six best selling books, seven books in total. Including <a href="http://m0a.com/store/private-pilot-checkride-ebook">Pass Your Private Pilot Checkride</a> and <a href="http://m0a.com/store/e-books/instrument-pilot-checkride-ebook/">Pass Your Instrument Pilot Checkride</a>. All books are actually examiner’s questions. Every single questions of the examiner’s are the proper answers to those questions are compiled all into a book for you guys just to enjoy. Also the book Inflight Emergencies which videos and clips you&#8217;re gonna see today. </p>
<p>I was also privileged to be asked by the FAA to rewrite <a href="http://m0a.com/store/flight-training-products/handbook-combo">Pilots Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge and Airplane Flying Handbook</a> include videos on that and most recent bestseller is the <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/faraimbook.com/');"  href="http://faraimbook.com/">FAR AIM in plain english</a> and took that big two hundred page FAR AIM condensed it down about a hundred pages. What you really need to know for your private sport pilot certificate and explained in plain english. Our most recent thing the aviation seminar at sea which I have you guys flyers about. We&#8217;re onto our second annual now. Aviation seminar at sea issuing advance and master wings credits to help remove your pilot certificate at sea went to airport, beach and St. Martin. It’s really a neat trip. What we gonna talk about today someone tells me earlier that the shirt is really appropriate “Keep calm and fly on” for Inflight Emergencies. What are we gonna talk about how to handle 3 types of emergencies.</p>
<p>Engine Failures in flight<br />
Engine Failures on take off (both with or without runway remaining)<br />
How to make a better plan for the unexpected</p>
<p>I definitely suggest having your notepads ready with that. So the first thing I want to talk about the Engine Failures in flight. I am gonna share this video with you guys, it’s slightly humorous on some point I had to bleep out all the colorful language so it’s PG I promise. The first really pioneers in flight video, is a company called data toys, the system was a very expensive to have so all people had it, these was the very first year event release on it, these two gentlemen are actually flying to this very event about six years ago and ended up having an engine failure in flight. So we gonna kinda watch this and analyze this incident, well I am not a big fan of gloom and doom stuff, certainly in a positive manner. They actually end up landing on a road and like pull into a taco bell so everything was okay.</p>
<p>You guys will able to see that, real quick . So let’s go ahead and watch this clip.</p>
<p>An engine failure in flight, again just to bring this home, I mean. These are two people just trying to do what a lot of you guys do and that is flying into the Sun N Fun. I mean I am really an interesting situation to see I can’t imagine that they had to call the police and say “Hey! I’m at the Taco Bell, Winter Haven and we need a tow truck.” This also brings up the other question though, and it’s debated a lot. Do I find was to land in the road, do I land with the traffic like they did in that case, do I land against the traffic, anybody of you have thoughts on that by the way with the traffic?, against the traffic?. I can see that on both ways. They’re so fortunate I mean next time you&#8217;re driving down the road and look up all the power lines that sort of stuff these people are so fortunate. It’s great and we can use this video and share this kind of experience. </p>
<p>Anybody ever heard of something called the ABC’s of an emergency? Anybody heard of that, Chris, I know you’ve heard of that. The ABC’s of an emergency. If that engine work equipped and this is something, this people affectedly following even though you don’t see all of it. </p>
<p>The A in our ABC’s stands for Airspeed. Airspeed is king just like the presentation yesterday on the secret and perfect landing, talk all about airspeed. Airspeed is king in this case, your slope, you don’t have that thrust, you need that airspeed, yes! the engine quits. You know at that point were on the expensive glide ride fully understand that. Let’s not stole that airplane. Let’s do whatever we can to bring that down as slowly and safely as possible. So pitching for BG are best glide speed, what’s gonna keep me aloft this longest possible to troubleshoot the issue? what’s gonna allow me to travel the furthest?. I am not gonna pitch for, I am gonna trim for. Trim is a foreman’s auto-pilot. I want to trim up about that thing so I can forget about airspeed so I can focus on the B and the C of my acronym. </p>
<p>The B stands for the best landing area, you’re exactly right. Now this is what I want to you guys to burn into your brain. I mean, I have a thousand upon thousands of hours teaching students and doing in flight emergencies scenarios. I pull that through all back the first thing every sue wants to do is to get tunnel vision what’s right out in front of me. As I kinda sick, flight instructor, all signs put that beautiful runway right back down behind them. And they’re just so glued on what’s in front of us and say “Listen what a beautiful runway right down there behind you.” So not to get tunnel vision keep that in mind, your best landing area might be behind you or below you and below you will be the best case scenario. So look for that best landing area and don’t get tied up in tunnel vision. Once you have that best landing area by the way you need to stay committed to that. You wanna talk about the quick way to screw up on a check ride, a quick way to screw up in a real-life situation like this, is to go “Ah, I got this field over here and in your head you go, nah nah this field looks better.” and towards this feel and you can’t commit to a decision. What happens is you missed both fields, ultimately. Once you picked that point. You got to stick with that point. Cause you gonna devote all that last bit altitude you have, to actually making that point. </p>
<p>The C in our acronym is for our checklist. I fully understand not in every scenario. Are you gonna able to pull out the checklist and fumble around these papers. You may be making the most important landing of your life. I totally understand you may not have time to fumble to that checklist but you should have some sort of flow check memorized. You’re gonna assuming you have time. For example in the Cessna 150, 512R that I fly, you guys see in all the videos. If I were having an engine issue. I’m gonna start on the floor with my fuel selector valve. I will work my way up to check the mixture. I will come across to check my car key or all that passes fuses. Fuses aren’t gonna help me with anything. All the way over check my primer, check my mission. Okay, I’m gonna troubleshoot all the things. I had a whole flow check and you read my actual checklist. Exactly what tells you to do. I just have it memorized from the floor, up, and over. Easiest way to remember. It’s called the flow check. Do it through muscle memory and that’s gonna help you a ton. From there, I&#8217;m squawking 7700 and I’m really talking to anybody to listen. A lot of the older books he says “You&#8217;re the 121.5”. You know what! no one wants listen to 121.5 anymore. It’s just a reality. Yes I know the civil air patrol does. Yes I know some airliners still listens to it. But all these towers closure that may happen now, they’re are really not gonna listen 121.5. So I’m gonna jump on some frequency and somebodies gonna listen to me. So I can tell them what’s up. I have used 121.5 such a reliable source as we used to say five years ago anymore. So see this checklist. This of course, like we saw in our video is certainly time committing. These guys in this case they are what? you know they are approaching in the Sun N Fun, have read a note in the wild but it’s you know 1200-1500 feet you are coming in here. You don’t have time for a checklist. They made the right decision, pitch for my proper airspeed and find an area to land. They thought about the field they commit to the road and they stuck with it and have a positive outcome with that. Choose your field stick with it. If you don’t have time for a checklist that’s A-okay. Focus cause you’re gonna make the most important landing in your life effectively. Alright, so that’s our engine failure in flight. Let’s take a segue, real quick. </p>
<p>Let’s talk about “Planning for the unexpected”. By showing hands, who takes an airliner to Sun N Fun? Few people, okay. I know we have all flown on the airliners before. Who has, as a pilot, ever seat on that airliner, we as pilot we are not a humble bunch sometimes, seating in the back of that airliner, thinking over in the loudspeaker and said “Are there any pilots? Any pilots to the front of the cabin please. How many of us have really thought about that? You&#8217;re like I think I could do that! I&#8217;d raise my hand. We’re all think about that.  We’re all very cocky bunch. I don’t know what wrong with pilot. We all have that thought. </p>
<p>This is something that actually happen. It’s about 8 minute audio clip. I’m gonna show to you guys of a gentlemen. I’m talking brain, spanking,new <a href="../home/private-pilot/index.html">private pilot</a>. 50 hours, just pass his checkride as new as you can get. Decide he’s gonna celebrate by chartering a king air. He is not the pilot. He is chartering a king air to take his family on a vacation to bahamas, to enjoy and celebrate to his success of becoming a private pilot. Chartered a King Air 200 single pilot. He, his wife and the kids are all in the back having a great time. The pilot actually passes away in flight. Now, the only pilot on board is this 50 hour cisco 172 pilot who’s gonna have to hop in the seat of this King Air 200 and by the way his family is behind him. It’s slightly humorous and of course again everything I show you guys always have a positive outcome. We are not into that gloom and doom sort of stuff. But just to listen to how he interacts with aircraft control. How he works with it. You see that in this 8 minutes video clips.</p>
<p>One of my favorite clips so far. I shared the whole thing with you. The whole thing runs about 30 minutes and you can get the entire thing inside that book I mentioned earlier “In flight emergencies: How to handle the Unexpected.” It really talks about that six scenarios that runs through our minds sometimes as pilots. If I was on that airliner and they call for any pilots on board. Could I handle that situation?. Needless to say this gentleman did a great job for a guy from southern Georgia. Not that you guys could tell that by any means. Just a neat story. You could find the whole thing in the book and he ends up making a better landing the most King Air pilot could make and gets everybody on the ground safely but It’s just cool to really see that interaction between pilots. Even low time pilots. Flying something like that, end of controllers. If you notice just how calm that silly guys is. I’ll be up there shaking my boots, you know. for him to be out, I mean. There are sometimes where he&#8217;s getting professional. Left to two seven zero niner delta whiskey.</p>
<p>He was calmed though. Just a really neat situation. I want to show you the full things in the book, you guys want to check that out. So that’s a plain for the unexpected. Guys we walk in the situations all the time flying friends, chartering King Air for goodness sakes. You should always be ready and always planning and prepared for the unexpected situations. So we are in the third and final thing I’m want to share with you guys is this. I’m ready to warned that needs the most attention, because this is a huge catch area for pilots.</p>
<p>It’s the engine failure on take off. Again, you are in the situation you are low, you are slow, you are very high angle of attack, you are the heaviest you are ever be in the entire flight during take off. So two situations that I wanna run through with you guys. The first with the runway remaining. This is really, if I was having an engine failure I’d take off. This is the preferred situation to have. I simply take off. I did a few hundred feet above the ground, the engine quits, I notice that back, down, land safely. It sounds so easy. Has anybody ever actually practice this? Literally, five or ten thousand foot runway, you go out, you take off, did a hundred feet and pull out throughout back to idle. </p>
<p>Jason: What surprised you most about it, when you did it? </p>
<p>Audience: You had to push down immediately.</p>
<p>Jason: You’re exactly right. </p>
<p>You get up, you pull that throttle back to idle and before that throttle hits idle the stall warning horn is on, it&#8217;s already on. You have to knows that thing down so much almost upon where your butt’s leave in the seat cause you better be buckle in tight. To get down even have a shot in making that runway. You have to think instantaneous and I challenge each and everyone of you here to go out like this gentlemen said in the clip before “Find the longest, wildest runway you can and go out practice something like that.” You can do it for free. </p>
<p>Do it from a full stop, take off, get to just a hundred feet and have an instructor somebody smoothly bring that throttle back to idle. You will be shocked! How much first off pressure and How quickly you have to push that nozzle over. And something every single take off you will be ready for. We always talk about you know still caught that no talking about last night’s football game and it’s kinda like that . No fumbling around with stuff, you know when you are trying to setup your approach frequency as you taking off. Just a little distraction like that can end up by the end of the buff. So I highly encourage you guys to get out there and practice in engine failure on take off with runway remaining. Really, the prefered situation because the other one is without runway remaining. I have a clip of this, actually. And when you run into a situation without runway remaining. They like to use the phrase the impossible term. It got that word impossible for a reason. Well, a lot of people think is, I take off say “Did the five hundred feet the engine quits”. They think wrong. I just come back to where I came from and make that turn back wrong. What people don&#8217;t realize is, if I just made a 180 degree turn off the runway I just departed from I&#8217;m just on a downwind at that point. You know it really takes a 230 to 240 degree turn to come all the way back around to make that. It’s called the impossible turn for a reason. What I teach is, if you’re below one thousand feet AGL “above ground level.” You’re going straight ahead. It’s just that simple.I&#8217;ll give you like a 30 degree window. 30 degrees to my left and 30 degrees to my right. Way to maneuver it But I am low. I am slow. I am the heaviest of a bee. I am the high angle of a tack. Okay, this were four ingredients to stall spin scenario and now you want to add turn to it. Let alone a pretty extreme turn, 230 degrees back around just to make a piece of pavement. when in actuality out in front maybe a great field. One thing I do with my student is, you know, we work with that. Hey if we departed runway 28 where would be go if we had an engine failure flight. Where all jason there’s a road rider here. Oh, there’s that cow patch away over here. Knowing where all gonna go before we ever depart that actual field but I just want to beat that into your brains below a thousand feet you’re going straight ahead. And what you will see in this video clip. This is a gentleman who was about 1500 feet AGL flying a mooney. </p>
<p>Anybody flew a mooney? Notice if you take the power away from the mooney. It is a very expensive paperweight. It lights the fallout from the sky without that tower. This gentleman, this clip was actually taken from AOPA. Who departed, counting about 1500 feet, having an engine failure and opted to come back. You may have a good decision for 300 feet. I am totally okay with that. What I want you to see. First of all I want you to listen. Listen to this terrible noise this engine makes. You know, adding the noise, the gear warning horn the stall warning horn. All, this is playing into your mind as you trying to make, yet again, the most important landing in your flying career and I want you to know this, the bank angle and how much turn he has to make. He actually has to make two turns because the 230 degree of turn, put you out like a 45 degree angle. And then fly away whereas, where the bunch of runway again. He had to make two turns and he make extra turn when he came back around. So I want you guys to check out this clip, real quick. </p>
<p>Everybody always thinks in their mind “Oh man! Engine quits I’m going back.” Do you see the bank angle?That poor guy having, this man is doing the steep turn at about 1300 feet at that point. In my preference from turning left to be honest with you. I don’t know why he made right turn in that case. It may have just what came naturally. I’m not positive about that. You know but just to show the exaggeration of that turn. He had to make and by the way he didn’t just make one turn. He also make the second turn and then he saw. Did you saw the top of the airport? That mooney must have climb out of there like a little bandit because he was thankful for that displays., the threshold to the end of that runway cause he need that every little bit of that piece of pavement and just again you heard how hard that guy was breathing. You heard the terrible sounds of that engine is making the gear warning horn, the stall warning horn, everything going off at once. Now he made two almost three turn as he kind of isolated back and forth. My whole point of sharing that with you guys is it’s called the impossible turn for a reason. If you’re below a thousand feet just going straight ahead. It’s that simple. If you’re above a thousand feet you can make that turn back. This is something you can practice by the way. And I encourage you to go out and practice this. Go up, climb up the 3500 feet. Treat it like you’d practice and power on stall. Slowly your airplane down to about 60 rotation speed. Smoothly applied full powered treated 3500 feet like it’s the ground. Climb up, Climb up and get about 700 feet and try it. Bring that power all the way back and try to make a 230 degree back around and see if you can do it before 3500 feet. It won&#8217;t happen. You got to crank that thing your own so much and you’re such a stall spin scenario that’s why I want you up there try practice on it. Just to kinda see that and you may say personally for me and then jason said a thousand. I’m making a 1500 for me. The guy test that thing thats a high maneuver to do. So go up there and practice that sort of stuff.<br />
Just a real quick recap. We are actually done here. Just to recap the ABC’s of the emergency? </p>
<p>The A was what? Airspeed. Pitching forward BG my best glide speed. Was gonna keep me up there a little longest to troubleshoot and was gonna allow me to fly the greatest distant. </p>
<p>What was the B in the acronym? Best landing area. Keep it in mind where you’re best landing area would be? Behind us or below us. Don’t get in that tunnel vision scenario. Okay keep it in mind that your best landing area might behind you or below you.</p>
<p>And the C was what?! Oh yeah, the checklist and communicate. Checklist very much time permitting. If you’re a thousand feet and have an engine failure. I’m not gonna troubleshoot anything. I’m just gonna focus on landing that airplane on that point. </p>
<p>Okay, checklist, time, permitting, always be prepared for the unexpected like we learn from niner delta whiskey. Guys you never know what situation you’re getting yourself into. You may think you’re just going for lunch with your friend. He&#8217;s the pilot commander, whatever. You know, you’re lucky you even brought your headset along with you. You just have to fly for lunch. Always be prepared for the unexpected. Never fall into that trap of complacency. And the last thing we shared was never attempted turn back to the runway. The impossible term below a thousand feet AGL. AGL meaning “Above Ground Level.” Guys. I hope you really enjoy this. There are books available in the back. Especially, Inflight Emergencies. Again, three, the clips I shared with you. From that book there’s dozen more for you guys to enjoy so you can check those out. Everything is at $20 Sun N Fun special. Mostly these books are as high as $67 sometimes for the oral exam practice stuff. Now is your time to grab them. Also before you guys go something I’m very passionate about. These shirts you see here from the company called Pilot Life. You can visit <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/mypilotlife.com');"  href="http://mypilotlife.com">mypilotlife.com</a>. Just  like the brand Toms. The shoe company, you buy a pair of shoes, they gave away a pair of shoes. You buy a T-shirt all those funds going to Aviation <a href="../scholarship/index.html">Scholarship</a> for use. To really jumpstart the future of the aviation. Heard you guys to go check out mypilotlife.com and help those guys out and help the aviation. So guys that all I have for you today and the most important thing to remember is to be good pilot is always learning. Have a great day guys! See ya!</p><span class="et_social_bottom_trigger"></span>					</div> <!-- .entry-content -->
