		<description><![CDATA[Dear Jason,

I couldn&#039;t decide if this was a lesson of  &quot;When to Go Around&quot; or &quot; Short Field Landing and Takeoff &quot; .  You may be familliar with the runways involved since they&#039;re on you home sectional, but I provided an aerial photo anyway. No matter what the explanation it remains that the C 17 is just an awesome airplane. 

I think you&#039;ll enjoy this site. It&#039;s pretty entertaining and educational. Tracking is based on flight plans not transponders and works quite well if you keep in mind there is a 6 to 10 min. delay. 

Regards,

		<description><![CDATA[IMO, I like Go-Arounds!! Fun maneuver to practice . We have a lot of deer here in Norther MI and planes don&#039;t have a horn on &#039;em so a lot of times we deer on the rwy. A lot of they are if executed correctly. Nose down on climb out and def something to do a checkride.
Question: Why not log it in your log book?? &quot;XC to (destination), performed a go-around due to blah blah blah reason..&quot;. :)
Great video too btw. I always look fwd to your videos and  ce 512R. :)]]></description>

I executed a go around b/c I didn&#039;t like what I saw...so after cleaning the configuration of the airplane...I contacted the tower and said we&#039;re executing a go around.

		<description><![CDATA[If the approach doesn&#039;t look good or and obstacle shows up, just go around. One thing to be cognizant of is the nose rising too much and or quickly. I&#039;ve had to keep a little forward pressure on the stick to keep the speed building on one go around. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[About 2 months ago on the very same runway you just used, I was on short final when an aircraft taxied directly onto the end of the runway and started the takeoff roll. I aborted the landing and tried to contact him while diverting to the right of the runway, but he never answered and may not have had a radio. Another aircraft in the pattern witnessed the event and estimated we were less than 6-8 seconds from making contact with one another. 

I&#039;ve gone around many times, but that one will be memorable for awhile...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I go around when small corrections in aimpoint, airspeed, and glide path are not working. Over controlling the airplane in landing configuration low to the ground is not the time to fight. Also wild life like birds and deer and maybe people, or a runway incursion by another aircraft. and such on the runway. Just go around. And remember full throttle, RIGHT RUDDER!,  hold that yoke ( fight the bloat) and be aware of airspeed, get one notch of flaps up ( if full) and climb at  VX. Fly the plane. Positive rate of climb start to retract remaining flaps. Then make your radio call when able.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanx Jason.  I&#039;d also be curious to know the &quot;approved solution&quot; for what you should do AFTER the go-around (for example, if someone is delayed on the runway due to blown tire.)  What should your pattern look like?  Would you simply stay at pattern altitude and continue your circuits until the runway is clear?  Would you fly directly over the runway on your upwind, or offset?  Would you make an &quot;upwind&quot; radio call?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I felt like quitting flying after my 2nd attempted landing on my 1st solo after having to do a go around with little experience practicing them close to the ground.

I forgot to anticipat right rudder and was 10 feet off the ground over the grass off the side of the runway. I forgot to anticipate forward pressure and didn&#039;t have enough lift to take off again and was slowly sinking. And I forgot to stop the flaps at 20 degrees and when they went to 0 degrees the plane sank a couple feet and my life flashed before me. Luckily I was able to regain control and it taught me a good lesson.

Practice practice practice go arounds both in the air and close to the ground.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Soon after getting my Private Ticket. I took a friend up and around the state. When I fly back to my home airport (towered), I was cleared for landing on runway 32R, I noticed that a Bonanza off to my 9 o&#039;clock position who was given clearence for runway 32L  sped up and shot accross me to land on the incorrect runway. I was in a continuous position to land on my assigned runway but obviously the other Pilot got confused. He landed ahead of me and I quickly called Tower and CCCC&#039;ed it came around in the pattern and made a greasy landing on Runway 32R. Thank goodness for Situational Awareness.

		<description><![CDATA[This is incredible timing and so important. I love you Man. Here is my story from yesterday. Temperature 91 degrees, humidity 40%, variable winds, 5pm and I am taking a private pilot in a DA20 to a 2500 foot grass strip about 20 miles east of Ann Arbor, MI. Due to the density altitude, thermals, 75 foot trees at the threshold, my fantastic Instrument student had to do 3 go-arounds because the Diamond did not want to land. Each go around was during the landing flare. The 90% mental, I would change to 95%. When flying into areas that require pretty tight tolerances the go-around should be a high priority item on final approach. This video is going on my private pilot syllabus.  ]]></description>
