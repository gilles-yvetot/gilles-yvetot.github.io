		<description><![CDATA[I would actually set a floor for a negative return. Your statement leaves the possibility that you could be at TWO thousand feet and you would not turn back to the runway. One thousand feet? Yeah, I&#039;m making the 180. 800&#039;? No way. I think you mistyped.

I also left a comment on your other blog (10 November) about taking off before or after the point of rotation of a heavy in front of you. I think you got it wrong. You suggested taxiing down the runway a bit (as an option) to make your point of rotation AFTER the point of rotation of the heavy. I&#039;m scratching my head, because this is clearly isn&#039;t a typo, and it&#039;s clearly wrong. Instead of putting out bad information, you really ought to go back and fix it. Here is the statement in question:

&quot;Say you are holding short and a Boeing 747 just took off, what do you do? This happens to many pilots and most are not completely sure of what to do. There are a few options. You want to make sure you look for his or her point of rotation, because these vortices do not start until he rotates and starts generating lift. One of your options is to taxi down the runway a bit until you will takeoff after his point of rotation. &quot;

		<description><![CDATA[A safety briefing for passengers should be something like this.

- Seat Belts
- How to Open and Latch Doors
- Emergency Exits (Doors and baggage door)
- Sterile Cockpit below 1,000 ft

Hope that helps! You can always add more

		<description><![CDATA[A mouthful? Let&#039;s check my take-off briefing then:

Normal or performance take-off for runway XX (intersection Y)
Take-off distance available XXX meters
Rotation at XX knots
Initial climb at XX knots
Any problem on ground stays on ground
Engine failure after take-off, land straight ahead
Other problem after take-off, we&#039;re IMC / VMC today so we&#039;ll climb to the minimum sector altitude and request vectors back to fly an approach / fly a left hand (right hand) circuit

That&#039;s pretty much it. Oh, and if it is a twin, add the VMCA and blue line speeds.]]></description>
