		<description><![CDATA[I Don&#039;t necessarily agree with you on that completely because what if your in IMC conditions the entire time? You wouldn&#039;t be able to see it. However I do know ATC will usually advise you  if the is a thunderstorm along your route of flight and will then vector you around it. On the other hand they might be to busy and don&#039;t have to. If you are VFR on an IFR flight then yes I could understand your view but as we know thats not always the case.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jason,
Your website is great.  In east Tennessee we have a configuration of mountains and just the right amount of ingredients to make storms blow up in a hurry. I mean matter of minutes. As the temperature changes so can the weather to drastic measures. I have been caught on a lake in a boat with beautiful clear calm sunshiny weather. We heard thunder in the distance and began to bolt back to the dock just several miles off.  We didnt make it. Lightning was striking along the banks as we pulled off and docked at the nearest location.  You may not &quot;fly into a storm&quot; , but a storm may suddenly mushroom up around you. Thanks again for the greatness.]]></description>

Great Comment and thank you for your kind words!

Sounds like that CFI wasn&#039;t making some good calls but who am I to say.

Good call on the turn around

		<description><![CDATA[Jason,

You&#039;re right. The books i&#039;m referring to have copyrights from as old at 1960ish to early 80&#039;s. So quite possible it&#039;s a shift in attitude. I certainly don&#039;t believe thunderstorms were much kinder and smaller than they are now :)

Great way to look at it,
Jason]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jason,have to agree 100% , which pilot of sound mind would even contemplate an entry into a major storm such as a thunderstorm, if its because they think they are bullet proof well then all the power to him/ her they would certainly need it. I was &quot;ordered to go into a storm front during my first dual Xcountry with the words still ringing in my ears, &quot;its alright I know this country like the back of my hands(CFI)&quot; simply responded with &quot;well it looks like Ive failed my Xcountry then dont it&quot; and promptly turned around. and returned home
Awsome jason, great videos

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting question, and interesting responses so far.  As a low-time VFR pilot, I would have to agree completely with your assessment.  As one who would rather be old than bold, and given our knowledge of these storms&#039; ferocity, it would be a poor choice indeed to push through.  But...

As an avid reader of aviation history, I was actually surprised that you didn&#039;t have more disagreement with your statement.  I suspect there may be a demographic issue that may be illustrating a major shift in pilot risk management and ADM.  Long story short, reading about the exploits of pilots from the early days (take Earnest Gann for example), there are frequent references to horrible turbulence, thunderstorms, icing, and all manner of death-defying (and some not-so-defying) adventures.  

Could it simply be that many of the books written with the &quot;push through&quot; mentality reflect the attitudes and technology of that era?  Even those written in the last 20 years still might have those sorts of pilots as an audience, or at least those sorts of pilots as instructors of said audience, for better or worse.  Perhaps your site, attracting (I&#039;ll guess) a younger and perhaps more conservative breed of pilots, reflects the changing attitudes that come with learning from others&#039; mistakes.

Keep up the great work!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jason,
First of all, you are 100% right, flying into a thunder storm is nothing short of suicidal. Anyone who has been trained properly and has an IR should know better and should take evasive action long before the point of no return, because in most cases it will be the no return.
