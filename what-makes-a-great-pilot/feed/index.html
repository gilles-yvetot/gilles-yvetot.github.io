		<description><![CDATA[There are 77 comments about what makes a great pilot. All of them are very good.  I like to think of this question as what makes a good pilot an aviator. Some would say they are one in the same but there are many differences.  A pilot takes a written test comprised of less than ten percent of the available database questions and only has to get seventy percent of those correct. A pilot takes a check ride that is normally scheduled for the best weather day available, has gone over the ride with his instructor numerous times, gets a good nights sleep and is totally prepared to pass the ride. Unless the student pilot does something unsafe he or she will normally pass the ride and then begins to learn all the things that were not taught during the training.  A good pilot is always learning but to become an aviator that pilot must also be always thinking.  An aviator is always striving to be the best. Always thinking of what could happen and having a plan for a safe outcome of any situation that presents its self.  You need to constantly be thinking outside the envelope. Always asking yourself the &quot;What if Questions&quot; and talking with fellow aviators to develope plans of actions.  Would you remain calm if you lost one of your engines on a twin engine aircraft? No big deal. But what if when lowering the flaps they split. A little bigger deal for sure. So you burn off fuel while circling hoping for a cross wind to help keep the wing up and then you lower the gear only to have 2 green lights instead of three. This happened on a test flight of a twin Beech many years ago.  I was with an aviator who made all the right decisions because he had thought about what could happen and what action he would take if it did.  We landed safely.  A good pilot is always learning but also always thinking.  Kenn Hinick]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Steve,

What a great story! Gives me goosebumps... One of those &quot;How did he know&quot; kind of things.

I really appreciate you sharing and know we can all learn something from this.

To summarize it best a great pilot is always thinking ahead of the airplane and ahead of the situation. Never flying around &quot;fat, dumb, and happy&quot; always prepared and always thinking

Wonderful story thanks so much!

Jason]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A Great Pilot

Let me tell you the story of Hollis McAdams. I was learning to fly, and took a job cleaning the corporate jets to put myself through school. I worked for Pogo Oil &#038; Gas, and Hollis was my boss, the chief pilot. Hollis was a WW2 bomber pilot, and was always looking to build his skill, and do all the things Mike Bennett talks about below. We had a G1, and ever time a G1 had an accident or incident, he would gather the pilots and mechanics together in a sort of &#039;task force&#039; to find out what happened, so we could build into our process for our G1 countermeasures to keep us from that same type of failure. They knew everything about the fleet. Best Practices is not always enough- though a good place to start, and that is what Hollis did. He used Best Practices as a place to start. One day when it was raining, and there was nothing to do, he told me a story. He was flying a mission over the pacific in IFR conditions, and there was not radar to speak of. He asked his co-pilot, &quot;what if some guy busted through the clouds right in front of us coming straight at us? What would you do?&quot; His co-pilot said, &quot;I would pull back on that yolk as hard as I could!&quot; Hollis said, &quot;So would I. And I betcha the other guy would too. How about if we encounter that situation, we push down instead.&quot; 20 minutes later, that exact thing happened. They pushed down and the other plane yanked up- the planes barely missed eachother, and they both looked at each other in silence. Finally the co-pilot said, &quot;How did you know?&quot; Hollis said, &quot;I didn&#039;t.&quot; But he has a mindset of looking through situations and making a unique procedure for that situation, hoping he will never use it. This mindset and care also opens him up to the hand of Divine Providence, which uniquely prepared him to react as was needed, in a way that could not be forseen. A great pilot- gain all the skill you can, put you mind in a place where providence can reach you, and trust the unseen. Always look out for your passengers, and deliver them safely.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jason,
A great pilot is someone who knows how to fly in both basic and adverse situations. As well, they are very knowledgeable about smaller details affecting safety, like weather and NOTAMS. 
Great pilots are able to adjust to new conditions and situations while in the air, very safely and effectively. 
Keep up the great work. I really enjoy your videos.
