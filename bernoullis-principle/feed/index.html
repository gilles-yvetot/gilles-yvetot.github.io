		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jason, Brian here. Great definition and the typical one you read out of most private pilot books. However, it doesn&#039;t tell the reader anything about what Bernoulli really discovered. Let me explain.

Bernoulli proved that pressure, which is really just energy, follows the law of conservation of energy. This law states that energy is not created nor destroyed, only transfered. Applying this to pressure we now know that total pressure remains unchanged and there is a balancing act between static and dynamic pressure; just like total, kinetic, and potential energies taught in 8th grade science.

So my question to you is: Since virtually everyone has, at some point, been taught the law of conservation of energy and one of the best, arguably of course, methods to teach is to teach from known to unknown. Why do you, and most pilot books in your opinion, avoid spending a few paragraphs on Bernoulli and instead opt for the one liner that doesn&#039;t really tell anything about Bernoulli or the science involved?

I&#039;ve been racking my brain on this for some time and I really look forward to hearing your opinion on it.

Thank you,

~Brian

PS Just for accuracy sake -- in most flight configurations, the static pressure below the wing is also negative, relative to ambient, and not positive.
