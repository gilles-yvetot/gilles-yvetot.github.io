Why should it have raised &quot;very big red flags.&quot;  The pilot should have clearly stated that a plane took off and nearly hit them, then your flag would have been raised.  Play the roll of the controller and LISTEN to what the pilots were saying. I&#039;m not saying the controller was right, but you are wrong.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Clearly, the controller had questionable situational awareness as it is obvious that the controller’s failure to see and track
airport activity from the tower could have led to a disaster. Kudos to the pilot of United 2998. Having the wisdom to hold short and let the confusion be worked out was very prudent.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Got some of my flight numbers mixed below. This incident was undated and many things have recently changed. After the controller fell asleep at DCA and a B 737 pilot had to land at an &quot;uncontrolled airport&quot; the FAA required that two controllers be on duty. In this case only one controller was present. Ground transponders are required at many airports in the last couple of years. I don&#039;t know where this one was or it&#039;s class. Accidents are a collection of errors and breakdowns, never one thing.
You learn about flying from things like this. It&#039;s painless learning]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I recently had a long conversation regarding an incident at Denver. The tower controller didn&#039;t see an aircraft off loading on an active runway. In both cases the PIC and FO were clearly rattled and the controller threw fuel on the fire. The arrogant controller was clearly miffed with the U.S Air pilot who wisly declined take off clearance. 
I think the FAA has recently changed policy requiring two controllers to be on duty, but some investigation is needed to find out why the local traffic controller and the ground controller, same person here, couldn&#039;t see the area where United 1448 was transiting, and next, why wasn&#039;t 1418s ground transponder working. It seems the lessons of Tenerife go unheeded. 
Further, the PIC if 1448 figured out where he was and the controller told him he couldn&#039;t be there. I don&#039;t think she ever pulled out her binoculars or even checked the departure end of 5R/23L for lights Strobes are a good clue that another aircraft is there. The only one who showed good sense was the U S Air pilot who said: &#039;I&#039;m not moving until you clear this up.&#039;
The controller needs to be given some time off and then put back in short pants. Retraining is an understatement, her attitude needs adjusting before she kills someone.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is a clear case of the controller not listening to what the pilots of United 1448 actually realized they were on 23L and said so.  The controller just didn&#039;t hear that or was not listening to it.  The fact that a plane took off, and the pilot reported a plane taking off should have raised very big red flags.  The controller, though replied that you should not be anywhere near an active runway, not conceiving that what the pilot was telling her was that a plane just took off across his nose.  At this point the controller should have stopped everything to find out what was going on,
My hat is off to the pilot of the US 2998 that decided to remain short until the situation was clarified.]]></description>

Isn&#039;t there some technology that can take a transponder code and show the Controllers where planes are on the airport?
