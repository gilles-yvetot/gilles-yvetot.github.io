		<description><![CDATA[One thing you didn&#039;t cover which is pretty important during practicing is to think about safe landing options during the climb-out after you&#039;ve completed the exercise.  One of the times when an engine is most likely to give out would be shortly after application of full power after a cooling descent.

In the video you picked a clear spot in the middle of a wooded area;  if you powered away and the engine quit right as you were crossing the upwind boundary of the safe landing area, would you be in a position where you were low, at or below climb speed, and with nothing but forest in front of you?

Something to think about for practice sessions.  In a real engine-out situation it&#039;s obviously not important (!)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great video.  The procedures were articulated very well.

I had someone give me a tip not too long ago.  On the common trainer aircraft, they said, full nose-up trim usually coincides closely with best-glide speed.  I tried it on my C-172 trainer and it did seem to work.  In the past I tended to fish a little bit for best-glide speed, even fixating for a moment on that process.  Lately, I&#039;ve started throwing in handfulls of nose up trim, knowing that&#039;ll get me to best glide, so I quickly move in to picking best place to land and handling my flow check.

I wondered if you saw anything wrong with this procedure?  I&#039;ve been trying to think if there&#039;s potentially some problems with throwing in full nose up trim?  Only thing I can think of is that if it&#039;s a simulated engine failure, you&#039;ll need to be firm on the yoke when you go full power so you don&#039;t get drastic nose up and potential stall.  Thoughts on this?

Thanks again for a good video.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Never can forget your ABC&#039;s . Nice added emerg procedure protocol
or in my case left to right
Fuel Selector
Carb Heat
mixture

always left to right 

Another one I was taught is for cruise flight / leveling off 
Pitch
Power
Trim

Always enjoy your videos!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great video...But I would like to hear your thoughts on how you judge whether you can make the emergency landing site or not. I fly a C172 - and under optimum conditions I can engine-out glide 1.5 miles for every 1000 ft of altitude. But I don&#039;t know if in an emergency engine-out situation I would want to be looking at a sectional trying to determine the distance to the landing site...In the last 6 months we had a Sirrus land short enough from the airport after engine failure he had to deploy the chute. So even with sophisticated navigation equipment (nearest airport, etc) he didn&#039;t make it. So what do you do? Having thought about it I pick something I know I can reach and stick with it - even if it is not optimum. And I&#039;m talking something not too far from me that I know I can circle, setup an approach, and land the best I can...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice video. I haven&#039;t done much of this yet so I&#039;m not sure what my instructor will do, but I know some of the guys in the area go out over farm fields and make their students fly it down to a couple hundred feet - one even has an arrangement with a local farmer that they can land in a hayfield, if the student picks the right field he&#039;s going all the way in. One thing I&#039;ve been taught, is to try and get to the field a little high, then slip to lose altitude if necessary - that way if you miscalculate your glide you might still make it. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Indeed a great video! I am rotary wing pilot. First and foremost thing a pilot needs to believe is that &quot;I can have an emergecy in the most difficult situation and in any phase of flight ie take off, landing enroute over built up areas, over water bodies etc&quot; Then with this in mind the pilot has to prepare himself for all situations. Being prepared is to anticipate engine failure and accordingly revise his actions for the dynamic situation. If he feels that no action is possible for this situation, then his flight needs to be changed to cater for a favourable action in case of an emergency. eg engine failure over built up areas;  no field avaible, so i shoud avoid this area while flying.
Also lot of preparation on ground like revision of emergency actions and discussion with other piots will give u a lot of new ideas for a situation not given in the check list.

More to come from me on this subject.

Happy landings.

		<description><![CDATA[Jason,

     HUGE fan of yours. So true too. My CFI always states - if my airspeed isn&#039;t 70, then I better make it 70. Even if it means trading Alt for Airspeed.  Keep up the good stuff my friend.

Looking forward to more,

		<description><![CDATA[I live in NYC and fly out on Long Island, which means that pretty much everywhere in the local flight area is within range of a beach, making emergencies a virtual no-brainer. This is of course good from a practical sense, but not so good for training as you want to be prepared for when a nice long beach isn&#039;t guaranteed to be within glide distance. So during emergency practice my instructor would often tell me that the beach was &#039;on fire&#039; and not an option for landing, forcing me to look for other suitable landing fields. 

Wouldn&#039;t you know it, on my checkride the examiner did the exact same thing; during the emergency test, he told me the beach wasn&#039;t an option for landing, and made me find a less obvious place to set down.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for a good video, Jason.  The thought  of an engine failure is one of the things that makes me most nervous as a student.  What about a forced-landing checklist?  What things should be on your list of to-dos if you see that you are really going to have to put it down in the dirt.  I&#039;d like to know what you think would be important.  One thing my instructor came up with is reducing the prop (constant speed) to minimum, in order to eliminate as much parasitic drag as possible and extend the glide. ]]></description>
