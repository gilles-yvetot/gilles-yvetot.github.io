		<description><![CDATA[Too many pilots are afraid to fly with crosswinds - but what about when you take off in good conditions, and by the time you&#039;re ready to land, the wind has changed? I&#039;m a student nearing my checkride, and when I&#039;m practicing, I deliberately seek out the chance to take off or land crosswind, especially at airports with both crosswind and upwind runways. That way if things go badly on the crosswind (landing) I can go around and switch to an upwind landing if necessary. Better get the takeoff right, there&#039;s not much chance for a do-over if you don&#039;t. One thing I&#039;ve never done but look forward to trying on my next practice flight, is looking back out the rear window to see where I am in relation to the runway. One caution on practicing crosswind maneuvers - double check your math. I recently requested and got the crosswind runway. Halfway in, the tower called and asked if I&#039;d like to change my mind and land on the upwind runway, I thanked them and said I wanted the practice. After a VERY challenging landing, as I taxied to the ramp I redid the math and realized that the 14 kts. of crosswind component was a couple knots more than the rated ability of the C152. I did make a pretty good landing out of it, though.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Correct me if, I´m wrong:
This scenario was Takeoff Rwy 27 with Wind 36006 - that is right to left.
So the aileron input was right (into the wind) and the rudder input would be right too, to crab a little towards north .
So &quot;rudder left&quot; must be an error?

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;ve got to remember. Last time I updated my logbook I had 8,000 some odd hours of sitting my butt in the right seat! 

I feel weird in the left seat hahaha

I can still access everything so it&#039;s no danger to anyone

		<description><![CDATA[Before takeoff I have the students answer 3 questions 1) Where is the wind coming from in relation to the runway in use, 2) How much wind, 3) Is it gusting? Next when taking the runway full aileron into the wind and decrease as the aircraft becomes responsive. The takeoff word of the day is rudder, rudder and rudder to keep the plane down the centerline. Upon takeoff the nose of the aircraft will weather vane into the wind creating a natural crab. Last thing is a quick look back, without creating vertigo, to see if drifted off centerline. Okay favorite crosswind takeoff: KARB runway 06, winds 20K G26 from 320, flying a Piper Arrow practicing for the CFI checkride. Learned how to do a crab climb with the plane headed 360 and tracking 060. ]]></description>
