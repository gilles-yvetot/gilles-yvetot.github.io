		<description><![CDATA[good video, thanks.  One &quot;minor nit&quot;, I think in departure, where you suggest keep wings level, you mention  &quot;turn&quot; (bank) &quot;takes away from you  horizontal component of  lift&quot;; I believe  you intended to say horizontal lift (which is created in any turn) diminishes vertical lift, supporting the control input of leveling  wings.  Best regards.  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Jason, good stuff as always. Last week I was returning from KCTY to X35 and had an eye opening experience. Landing RWY 9 at X35 the wind was stiff from the southeast, but as I began to flare my wind correction suddenly was all wrong and forced a quick go around. While climbing past the wind sock I noted a straight sock out of the north east. There was a 90 degree change in wind direction between 150&#039; msl and the runway. The next landing, knowing what to expect, was much improved.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for taking the time to make these videos! This weekend the wind was 20-25kts the time between the previous flight and my flight the wind changed 180 degrees. Unfortunately a 185 pilot landed on our 2700ft grass strip with the 20kt tailwind locked his brakes and blew right through the fence at the end of the runway which normally is a busy road so this guy was lucky. Bad example of decision making! ]]></description>
