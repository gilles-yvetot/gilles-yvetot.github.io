		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jason,
Great video, what about making one introducing Ipads into cockpits and the way we as pilots can plan and fly with it? What is needed to GPS, wx and other stuff on the Ipad making flights safer?

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Josh! Actually it doesn&#039;t that&#039;s the entire reason it&#039;s a half clipboard. Because a full clipboard would get in the way of the yoke.

Even at my height in 512R it works out great and doesn&#039;t interfere with the yoke

		<description><![CDATA[Jason - The timing of your post was perfect.  I purchased that kneeboard a month ago, and last Saturday was my first day to try it out.  It was phenomenal!  I have done all my flying the last year in a G1000, and wasn&#039;t sure I could find a need for the iPad in the cockpit.  But after Saturday, I was amazed at how much faster I could get information on the iPad with just a few swipes, as opposed to a lot of  button pushes and knob turns on the G1000.  (Which equates to more time looking out the window for traffic, and less time head down!)]]></description>
