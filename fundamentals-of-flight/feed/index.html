		<description><![CDATA[Gotta chime in with concern.  The fundamental basis for lift is deflection of air.  A fully symmetrical wing could not generate lift with the Bernoulli argument.  Your hand stuck out of the window in a moving car can generate lift, by the deflection of air.  A good resource of information on this discussion is Stick and Rudder by Wolfgang Langewiesche.  As detailed in that book, the Bernoulli vs. air deflection viewpoint was put to bed in the 1940&#039;s.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[JAnders,

You make a valid point. However I was using a fun somewhat &quot;childish&quot; example as if the two air molecules were friends and wanted to stay together. 

This story you saw in the video is actually the same one I used years ago during my CFI Oral exam and the examiner thought it was great.

Although you are correct keep in mind the medium. We&#039;re teaching student pilots not physics majors.

Great comment and I really appreciate your feedback keep it coming.

		<description><![CDATA[Jason,
Love your videos, but unfortunately there is no reason at all why the two molecules want to stay together.  There is a great, free,  online reference that goes into lots of detail here.  John S. Denker, writes in chapter 3 (http://www.av8n.com/how/htm/airfoils.html#fig-delay)

[quote]
This may come as a shock to many readers, because all sorts of standard references claim that the air is somehow required to pass above and below the wing in the same amount of time. I have seen this erroneous statement in elementary-school textbooks, advanced physics textbooks, encyclopedias, and well-regarded pilot training handbooks. Bear with me for a moment, and I’ll convince you that figure 3.3 tells the true story.

First, I must convince you that there is no law of physics that prevents one bit of fluid from being delayed relative to another.

Consider the scenario depicted in figure 3.4 [on the website]. A river of water is flowing left to right. Using a piece of garden hose, I siphon some water out of the river, let it waste some time going through several feet of coiled-up hose, and then return it to the river. The water that went through the hose will be delayed. The delayed parcel of water will never catch up with its former neighbors; it will not even try to catch up.

Note that delaying the water did not require compressing the water, nor did it require friction.

Let’s now discuss the behavior of air near a wing. We will see that there are two parts to the story: The obstacle effect, and the circulation effect.
[/end quote]

one of my favorite examples of pressure is to take a glass of water with a straw in it. blow across the top of the straw and you will see the water rise up the straw indicating the drop in pressure.  If you blow hard enough, you will even be able to spray your neighbor when the water comes up the straw and interacts with the fast moving air ;).  enjoy responsibly.
