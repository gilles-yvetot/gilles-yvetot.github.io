		<description><![CDATA[Good article. I think slow flight is underrated in civilian pilot training. For me training slow flight to improve landings is a new concept, never thought about it that way. Additional value for this training is to get comfortable flying the whole AC envelope and to refresh initial stall indications. In onother words, if you get good at slow flight and especially at slow flight recovery, you might avoid some stall situations.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jason is so right...There are so many lessons - life saving lessons - that come from mastering Slow Flight. After all, what kills most pilots? Not maintaining Slow Flight - loss of airspeed and lift. If you have not mastered the art of Slow Flight and you are flying solo pattern work - you are playing with a loaded revolver...]]></description>
