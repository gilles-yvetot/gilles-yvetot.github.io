				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hypoxia &#8211; A deficiency of oxygen which impairs the brain functions and other organs.</p>
<p>The 4 types of hypoxia are</p>
<p><em>Hypoxic hypoxia</em> is the most common and is caused by decreased oxygen in air or the inability to diffuse the oxygen across the lungs. If this happens, the person has less than 100% saturation of the blood in the arteries. This can happen if you are at an altitude where the oxygen content of air is low (i.e., over 12,500 feet). Another problem would be if a person’s lungs were damaged so oxygen transfer was impaired (smokers beware!). </p>
<p><em> Hypemic hypoxia</em> is caused by the reduction of the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood. Anemia (low hemoglobin) can cause this. The oxygen is available, but there isn’t enough good blood to carry the oxygen. Carbon monoxide poisoning will cause this type of Hypoxia The blood holds on to the carbon monoxide from the exhaust leak in your engine and your capacity to carry oxygen decreases, you become hypoxic!  </p>
<p><em>Stagnant hypoxia</em> is caused by reduced cardiac output (the pump isn’t working good enough) or by venous pooling during high G force stresses. We are all getting older and we have to remember that the function of the heart is essential for pumping the oxygenated blood.  </p>
<p><em>Histotoxic hypoxia</em> occurs when all systems are working but the cells can’t &#8220;take&#8221; the oxygen from the blood. The oxygen is available. Alcohol or cyanide poisoning can cause this.</p>
<p>Some symptoms of Hypoxia are:<br />
Headache, Dizziness, Cyanosis, and Euphoria</p>
<p>These keep in mind are just a few</p>
<p>Everyone reacts differently, however you will repeat the same symptoms in the same order each time.</p>
