		<description><![CDATA[It should be emphasized that the amount of rudder you apply is whatever it will take to align the longitudinal axis of the aircraft with the centerline of the runway AND enough bank to get the component of lift to balance the lift from the fuselage that happens when you have the rudder applied. As you are flaring and slowing down, you will need to increase the rudder pressure to keep the airplane&#039;s longitudinal axis aligned with the runway and start DECREASING the bank as you get slower and slower until touchdown. The number 1 error I see with this maneuver is not decreasing the bank and the airplane starts to accelerate sideways into the wind and you touchdown skipping upwind. No books cover Crosswind Landings in this detail and it&#039;s just a matter of balancing forces. If you look at any Slip, adding rudder creates an angle of attack with the fuselage which is a lifting force and the airplane will turn uncoordinated if you don&#039;t balance that force out. You balance it by banking in the opposite direction and getting a component of lift (Lift Horizontal) to balance the lift from the fuselage. The fuselage is a lousy lifting device so it will not take a lot of bank to balance this force out. As you get slower and slower, you will notice the fuselage forces get smaller and smaller which means LESS bank angle. Apply this logic to a crosswind landing. Next time you are practicing crosswind landings on a real strong crosswind day, note which side of the centerline you touchdown on if it&#039;s not perfect. MOST errors are upwind of the centerline because nowhere is it written what to do with the bank as you get slower and slower. I heard someone tell me once that you apply enough bank to balance the crosswind. Umm, no. You do NOT balance a  Force with a Velocity. Horizontal Component of Lift does not balance a Crosswind. It&#039;s one of those apples and oranges things. Lift Horizontal is a Force which is in pounds and a Crosswind is a speed  which is in knots and one can not be applied in the same vector model.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I recommend you stay on the shot forward through the flare and landing so we could actually see what you were talking about.  During the kick-out to the slip, the shot was on your face talking.  Would also had been nice to have that shot from the surface of the runway pointing the other way (down the runway).  In general, when you are showing a maneuver, SHOW it; don&#039;t show you talking about it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jason, last week I listen to your webcast where you interviewed a pilot who experienced the lose of his Alternator. I wanted to share the interview with my CAP members. It really had an impact on me and I believe it would be an eye opener to them. However, can not find it to share. It sharing something you disallow. If not, it would be a great safety message.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Steve... My big &quot;beef&quot; with the side slip method is you&#039;re increasing the sink rate, causing the airplane and causing the airplane to be uncoordinated.... Forget to push that nose over just a few degrees and it can be a bad situation...

		<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t disagree with you Larry. The side slip CAN and IS an effective method as well.


That is assuming students remember to keep that nose coming down and that airplane flying :)


I personally find that the side slip method is too advanced early on in training. Students have enough to worry about... radio calls, turning to early/late, airspeed, am I too high? Too low? etc...


I just want to make it as easy as possible for them.


Both accomplish the same thing

		<description><![CDATA[So in MI I rarely get the winds going right down the runway so &#062;95% of my landings are crosswind landings. So if my crosswind landings are always high that means the students are the same. I look forward to those days because this is what you are going to deal with once you get the rating. First I have memorized the max crosswind component which is burned into my brain. So that is the max wind at 90 degrees to the runway that was demonstrated by the test pilots and still have aileron and rudder effectiveness. So as was wonderfully shown you must have a crab angle on downwind, base and final. Turning base to final I let mother nature push me onto my final approach leg. Wind from the left on a left pattern turn early and let the wind push me onto final. Wind from the right lag the turn and let the wind blow you to final. I do not use the crab method and then switch to the side slip. I love muscle memory. So when on final, as far out as I can I side slip all the way to flare and touchdown and keep the nose pointed down. Drifting left with a right crosswind more right aileron. I am using rudder to keep the airplane aligned with the extended centerline. This allows for me to make little adjustments. I also with gusty winds will use as little a flap setting as possible. As I slow down, with flaps the wind will affect me more with more drag. I have found with low time PP and students that the crap/sideslip transition is too many things happening when close to the runway. I have seen students put in the totally opposite aileron and rudder to what is needed and then the landing becomes a soft field landing off runway. Yuk. So that is my take. Fabulous video that should be put into the Aviation Museum Archive at the Air and Space Museum in Washington DC.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When I went through flight training, we were taught to transition to a slip when turning onto final, keeping the airplane aligned with the runway using the rudder &#038; using aileron to counteract the crosswind component.

Now, it seems like the crab is the preferred technique with the transition to slip coming on short final or even at touchdown, which to me seems like a much higher workload time to transition

What are the advantages of crabbing over a sideslip?  Why is the crab the preferred technique now, when the sideslip seemed to be preferred before?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You have to be careful with this because like you said at that point it becomes a slip.


Now you&#039;ve got inconsistant winds (because a steady crosswind is a myth) :) and you&#039;re causing a higher sink rate


Just a bad combo to find myself in

		<description><![CDATA[Why wait till the last minute? Is it safe (esp. as you are learning) to get the rudder and aileron in earlier...like much earlier... so its not so much of a guess at the last minute? I know it becomes more of a slip at that point but at least I have time to feel out the higher sink rate, and the needed rudder/aileron combo. Thoughts?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I like your video&#039;s but if you would have shown the exterior outside camera angle as you slipped it for the landing would have been better than see you talk about it. Also please copy the audio of your narration to the right channel as well. I&#039;m a little hard of hearing in the left ear and it would better balance out the audio.]]></description>
