		<description><![CDATA[Unfortunately I can&#039;t make it this year. I was planning on it, then work told me I had to cancel that vacation (which I&#039;d marked off in December...) so I planned the trip we just took last week in its place, and now of course it turns out I&#039;d be ok to be on vacation during Oshkosh week.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Still working on the videos/photos/blogs from Escanaba onward but I&#039;ve looked at the clips and must say there&#039;s some sweet footage in there!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve got about half of the trip blogged thus far, from Dayton to Traverse City to Escanaba. There will be 2 HD video clips per leg (or more) so it&#039;s a bit of editing/writing!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We flew Dayton &#062; Jackson &#062; Traverse City &#062; St. Ignace (over the Mackinac Bridge) &#062; Escanaba &#062; Oshkosh &#062; Kalamazoo (via Chicago along the shoreline route) &#062; Dayton. About 1250 miles in total over a week - we were delayed 3 days due to weather and being VFR.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&#039;s some great shots and video from passing by downtown Chicago at 2,500 feet (we were essentially level with the top of the Sears Tower - awesome sight!) that I can&#039;t wait to get posted. Landing at Oshkosh was a treat as well, even if we were a couple weeks early!]]></description>
