		<description><![CDATA[I started flying a Diamond DA40 with a G1000 last year and it is a great tool, but can be over whelming at first. I started with just getting checked out in the plane with the bascis first, then when I was feeling more comfortable I went up with an instructor and learned more advanced features. I only flew with an instructor or by myself for the first 10 hours in the DA40, now my wife and or family/friends enjoy taking trips in it. Great travel plane and the DA40 properly used can really reduce the work load on a long cross country flight.

		<description><![CDATA[While flying a glass cockpit, important to learn dealing with failures. Realise that Autopilot will go haywire with lost attitude and heading signals. If AP not disengaged, be ready to pull its CB.

		<description><![CDATA[Daunting is a good word to use...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The thing is these are fast little singles! We can&#039;t afford to fall behind them! A new beautiful panel is a great distractor and commonly causes students to fall behind the airplane.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My student has done about 10 hours in the Cessna 350 and a lot of book time. The funny thing is we both learn something new everytime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jason]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jason, I had a couple of great flights with Max Trescott in a Cirrus SR22T with Cirrus Perspective, which is a very lightly modified G1000 system. It&#039;s very cool but even stepping up from an Avidyne glass cockpit with G430s, I found it a little bit daunting. There&#039; s a lot going on and a lot of capability in the system. I reckon I&#039;d need a lot more training and then a lot more flying to be super-proficient with the system. But perhaps that&#039;s just typical &#039;I like what I know&#039; conservatism!]]></description>
