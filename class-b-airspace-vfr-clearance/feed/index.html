		<description><![CDATA[That is somewhat true, you can do flight following so at least they have a chance to know you&#039;re coming. But yes go-arounds can be common. Also you may get asked the question &quot;What&#039;s your maximum forward speed&quot; The answer 90kts doesn&#039;t bid so well with you landing chances :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keep the comments coming! Great question!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jason]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very nice, thanks for putting this up!  I haven&#039;t been through Class B airspace yet, only Class C, but I imagine it&#039;s pretty similar.  When landing, we word told by the tower to go around a couple times due to incoming Boeing jets.  Is that typical for small aircraft in Class B and C airspace?  I would think on an IFR flight plan, they&#039;d at least know you&#039;re coming and could space accordingly.  But on VFR flight plans, it seems you&#039;re just trying to sneak in between the big guys...]]></description>
