		<description><![CDATA[AIM 7-1-12(d)(3) &quot;Wind direction broadcast over FAA Radios is in reference to magnetic north&quot;

METAR CHAPTER - AIM 7-1-32(5) -...the first 3 digits are the direction in degrees in reference to true north.

Why did they do it this way??? To confuse pilots... :)

Does it make a difference? Only in a few parts of the lower 48

After all we report to the nearest tenth so if the winds are 181 and 183 it will be shown as 180 either way

		<description><![CDATA[Dear Jason,
In the trucking business, I have and occasionally still do drive and mechanic. Though, not an experienced engine fixer, I lend my hands on occasion to the guys who keep the line in operational equipment. I&#039;m as good a &#039;go-fer&quot; as there is. 



Sometimes it&#039;s not the major topics of your lessons, I learn the most from. Today you mentioned your druthers for leaning the mixture while taxiing to keep the plugs clean, I assume. The light bulbs brightened for me when I heard it. I operate many big block V-8s for the high performance I need in some applications. The points and plugs sometimes don&#039;t last more than a week of operation. While points are one issue the plugs all suffer from a rich mixture at low speed and idle so they don&#039;t perform under a load. ( 70k lbs 0 - 350 fpm in 45&#039; ). 



Thanks for the utterance. Let&#039;s see if I can come up with a usable application automatic enough to be usable without running afoul of the engine computer]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jason, I&#039;m confused how METARs can be true and ATIS magnetic for the winds.  If I get a metar report on aviationweather.gov for my local airport, the wind direction always exactly matches the audio of the metar when I listen on my aviation tuner (i live close to the airport).  So how can they be the same and different?]]></description>
