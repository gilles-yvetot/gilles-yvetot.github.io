		<description><![CDATA[A few comments:

1. &quot;Example: Dunnellon Traffic ….. and end with Dunnellon Traffic.&quot; Actually, the word &quot;traffic&quot; at the end is incorrect. The first time you say &quot;Dunnellon Traffic&quot;, you are calling the station(s). But at the end, you are stating the AIRPORT you are at. You should not say &quot;traffic&quot; there.

2. Giving the N numbers is superfluous, as others have stated. I don&#039;t care what your N number is... I care that you&#039;re high wing or low wing, turbo or piston, etc. So all I want to know is Cessna turning downwind or Cherokee turning final or Stearman taking off, etc. If it&#039;s all Cherokees in the pattern, maybe you could say &quot;Red Cherokee&quot;. That&#039;s 4 syllables versus 8 for &quot;Cessna Five One Two Romeo&quot; and a 50% time savings in a crowded pattern.

3. My airport shares 122.9 with about 4 other airports all within earshot of each other. Brevity is extremely important on a weekend with nice weather. If you can eliminate the words &quot;turning&quot; or &quot;runway&quot;, it is of great value when there are 5 planes in the pattern at each field.

So, &quot;Dunnellon Traffic, Cessna Five One Two Romeo is turning base for runway three five Dunnellon traffic&quot; can be condensed down into &quot;Dunnellon Traffic, Cessna Base three five Dunnellon&quot;. That takes you from 27 syllables down to 13, and 1/2 the time transmitting, thus 1/2 the opportunities to step on someone else in a traffic pattern 20 miles away trying to work their way into the pattern. And everybody knows exactly what you mean, without all the extra words.

Always think about who is listening, and whether they give a crap about what you are saying. Consider what you&#039;re going to say, and then say it as concisely as possible, removing every word that is not absolutely essential. Telling me you&#039;re turning crosswind is of little importance to me when I&#039;m inbound for the downwind. I am watching you lifting off and climbing out as I approach the field. I&#039;d rather know you&#039;re turning downwind because we are at similar altitudes without a lot of visible movement relative to me, and save that other time slot for someone at another airport who is turning final while someone is doing practice approaches. JMHO at a busy, busy, busy airport.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Forgive the extremely delayed comment but I do want to note that your Tip #2 is incredibly important. At my home airport we have numerous airplanes that are NORDO, since Cubs and Champs don&#039;t have electrical systems. I know I&#039;ve learned to keep my head on a swivel better than many simply because the Mark I Eyeballs truly are the only way to know where traffic&#039;s at. Of course, we should all be using our eyes but the key is that you never, ever assume the pattern&#039;s clear just because you don&#039;t hear anyone!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[:) Bob you crack me up!

and you&#039;re very correct brevity is the correct word to use explaining what you&#039;re talking about and that&#039;s hard to teach.

I believe all of us at one point or another will realize that &quot;quick and to the point&quot; will apply in certain scenarios.

Great comment!

On a side note how&#039;s the fixed wing coming?

That my friend is a perfect scenario. That way you&#039;re really staying comfortable in both types of airspace. I find that to be very smart!

Yep got it covered I needed to as the audio in some was annoying how it was cutting in and out.

Glad you enjoyed the videos!

		<description><![CDATA[Hey...HEY!  I never said I was &quot;annoyed&quot; at people who make &quot;crosswind&quot; calls - only that I find them superfluous (and couldn&#039;t find them at all in the AIM).  I say: It depends on the situation (and not the one on MTV, either).  If you&#039;re at an airport that uses 122.8 and it&#039;s *really* crowded at that time, then perhaps making more radio calls is counter-productive if it results in squealing from simultaneous transmissions (perhaps from other nearby airports as well).  There can be too much of a good thing.  OTOH, my home base airport uses 122.72 so this is usually never a problem.  

As for N-number usage, I get you, I understand.  Still, students need to learn brevity when necessary.  Why, just yesterday I was in my (boss&#039;s) helicopter, approaching Tuscaloosa Regional Airport.  With the Univ. of Alabama football game that day, that place was BUSY!  The tower controller told me to report 2 miles southeast, as I was inbound perpendicular to his main runway.  But the frequency was so crowded I couldn&#039;t get a word in.  Finally, I was able to blurt, &quot;Helicopter&#039;s at the field boundary,&quot; then he cleared me to land.  Yes, I probably could (and should) have said, &quot;Tuscaloosa Tower, Helicopter Six Tango Hotel is approaching the field boundary,&quot; but since he knew who he was, and I was the only helicopter on his freq at the time, I figured he&#039;d know who I was.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Vincent,

We&#039;re not talking about adjusting the heading bug during a turn. Our hands are staying on the yoke at all times.

I understand you want to postpone &quot;non-urgent&quot; tasks but think of it like this...

Someone calls&quot; N512R Left Downwind Runway 23&quot; You as another pilot are naturally going to look at the start of the downwind where that aircraft is actually banking, again easy to see.

If you can&#039;t multitask (talk and turn) you might not want to chew gum either while flying :)

		<description><![CDATA[Bob,

I understand where you are coming from on this however my standpoint is teaching student pilots. I&#039;ve got to get them to understand using their tail number to identify themselves. Plus the tail number comes in handy when someone cuts me off in the pattern I know right where to go and get a phone number :)

Not big on the turning crosswind call? You&#039;d be really annoyed as one of my students as I even make them call the upwind too! Now this of course is only when we&#039;re staying in the pattern doing landing work.

Crosswind is important especially with all these yahoo&#039;s who enter downwind however they please.

		<description><![CDATA[Nice video, Jason!  If there is one thing that&#039;s routinely screw up, it&#039;s communication at non-tower airports.

I can only add one or two things.  1) I&#039;m not big on the &quot;turning crosswind&quot; call.  Personally, I think it&#039;s superfluous and just just clutters up what can be a very congested frequency (especially 122.8).  YMMV, of course.  2) N-numbers have NO PLACE on a CTAF.  They are absolutely useless, as well as a waste of frequency time.  I don&#039;t care if N1234 Delta is turning base; I want to know that a &quot;Cessna&quot; or a &quot;Cherokee&quot; is.  That way, I can look out and *positively* identify the traffic (or as positively as possible).  I mean, the guy I&#039;m looking at might not even be the one talking on the radio!  I&#039;m so anal about this that I sometimes will say, &quot;Ferguson traffic, Cessna 150 turning base, runway 36 Ferguson.&quot;  But like I say, I&#039;m anal.  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ya i know how that goes!

For a Private Pilot Certificate all you need is 3 landings at a controlled field? 3!?! Now that&#039;s the problem.

That&#039;s almost as bad as just needing 3 hours of night time to get your certificate.

Scary stuff!

		<description><![CDATA[No way!

That is nuts! You know that&#039;s the kind of stuff that happens though. People either fail to make communications or &quot;assume&quot; everyone else is.

I bet you check, check, and recheck now though for sure!

Great comment

		<description><![CDATA[Uncontrolled Fields…So it is Mother’s Day 2008. My wife and I are flying out of Northwest Regional (52F) – an Uncontrolled Field. We are flying to Ardmore, OK– about a 30 minute flight – to surprise my wife’s mother for Mother’s Day. We depart 35 early Sunday morning. I taxi to the runway, make the calls, and do the 360 to look for traffic. I announce my intentions and taxi onto the runway for immediate departure. Trees are on the South end of the runway – so there is a displaced threshold. The view is blocked, but I’m confident all is clear. We taxi and takeoff without incident. We have been in the air about 1 minute and wife says, “You know, that was kind of scary”. I said what was scary? She said, “How do you know somebody is not coming over the trees?” I told her – pilots talk to each other. We would know. That is not going to happen. We arrive and return without incident. Three days later my wife is getting ready for work. She tells me to come into the sitting room. On the TV is a picture of a Piper which has landed on top of the Stinson – which was departing (you guessed it) 35 at 52F. I just looked at my wife and walked out the room without saying a word…]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I guess since they drilled awareness and self communication into us pre-solo since they wanted us to be prepared for stuff like that, I became more comfortable with the thought that I might encounter it.

Which is kind of strange I guess.  I&#039;ve never been really self-confident, and somehow I thought I could spot and handle situations like that without it being a safety issue.  I guess looking back I don&#039;t know if that confidence was justified, especially since I was/am pretty unexperenced with everything.

I think it all boils down to being uncomfortable with things you aren&#039;t experienced in.  Since then I&#039;ve been trying to squeeze into those uncomfortable areas just a little bit every now and again, just to build experience and confidence.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree.  Seems like the field people trained at influences their outlook on this matter.  I had heard about that before I picked my school and even was talking to a towered field near here first before I picked my current untowered.  I knew that I would be nervous talking to ATC and wanted to drill it in by operating out of a class D.

Actually that towered field is not far at all from my homebase; 18 nm says skyvector.  We just did the minimum there for the private requirements though.  I did well from the very beginning IMO, and my instructor must have thought I didn&#039;t need more practice.  However for me personally, I was always a bit nervous doing it.  I guess I got a few more towered landings in on my long xcountry.

One of the first things I did after getting my licence was to go back over and do a few touch and goes there.  Just to try and get rid of that feeling.  (didn&#039;t fully work heh, but it helped)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dot dot dot...

Bad egg ruining all us untowered folk&#039;s reputation hah.

That is just crazy.

Most people out here communicate, and the worse I have seen yet are people just missing a single call, or staying on the wrong frequency and calling a tower.  The latter is pretty easily sorted out by reminding them they are still on CTAF.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Miles!

Boy do I know what you&#039;re talking about!

But  listen to this...

We had a pilot come into Dunnellon yesterday (very much an uncontrolled airport as you saw from the video)

Saying &quot;Dunnellon tower Cessna 1234 just wanting to confirm clear to land runway 5&quot;

and my student and I were just staring at each other saying &quot;man we need to get out of this guys way because he had no idea what was going on&quot;

A few times I asked him what his location was and he kept calling me &quot;Dunnellon Tower!&quot;

I said &quot;no sir i&#039;m not a tower this is an untowered airport, you need to make position reports!&quot;

He came back and said &quot;Dunnellon Tower am I clear to land runway 5?&quot;

Needless to say my student and I just departed the area after that! No way was I going to share the airspace with someone who was that nuts.

		<description><![CDATA[Unsurprisingly, I have exactly the opposite aversion; I get nervous at non-towered airports. I am about to finish up my private certificate at KHPN, which is a modified Class D, in that you need to first talk to NY approach before being handed off to the HPN tower prior to entering the Class D airspace. Although I still am scanning for traffic all the time, having someone on the radio who knows where everyone is very comforting, especially when combined with our trainers&#039; G1000 TIS.My stress level is highest when I go to non-towered airports. Even though I&#039;m comfortable with making the calls, knowing that there might be people out there not making calls  (or even planes with no radios or transponders at all) trying to share the airspace and runway with me is very unnerving.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Michael!

You&#039;re exactly right it always seems pilots are better at one over the other. It really depends on what your home airport was like.

Luckily we&#039;re spoiled and have a Class Delta just 8 miles East so getting my students talking to a tower is no problem.

Great Comment,

		<description><![CDATA[Seemed like a really big pattern.  That 152 must be able to glide like mad ;)I trained out of an untowered field, and I suppose that during training communication kind of came natural.  I had a few hang ups now and again, but for the most part did well I think.However since I didn&#039;t get a ton of experience at towered fields, I feel awkward communicating with them.  Even now that I have my licence.  I usually spend a bit of extra time during planning making sure I have all the frequencies handy, and knowing what to say to them.  It definitely takes work, but for the most part I don&#039;t mess up too bad there either.  

Although it seems like I have to remind them that I want to land when I&#039;m abeam the numbers all the time... I think they forget about me heh.]]></description>
