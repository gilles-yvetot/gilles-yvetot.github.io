		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the guide to use flight computer

Well I did with pen and paper..  First and third was accurate and the second was more of approximate.

here is how I calculated..:

Q1: Very simple 85 kts for 35 minutes how much is distance travelled?

Ans: We know that 85 kts for 60 minutes will travel 85 nm

so in 35 minutes will be 85 / 60 x 35 = 49.5 nm

Q2: not so easy True course 170, wind 220 at 12, airplane speed  110 kts find Ground speed

Ans: Here a little approximation factor comes. If the aircraft was flying directly into wind it would have been easy  110 - 12 = 98. but there is 50 degrees variation. So I did an approximation of around 3 and calculated the speed to be 101.

But this was approximation

Q3: Again easy to calculate.: climbing to 4500 at 500 fps speed 70kts calculate distance.

Ans. First calculate the time to reach 4500: climbing at 500 feet per minute. which is 4500 / 500 = 9 minutes. Then calculate the distance traveled in 9 minutes traveling at 70 kts. which is again easy like in first question:
in 60 min distance traveled is 70 nm
so in 9 min the distance should be 70 / 60 x 9 = 10.5 nm which is the answer.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Q1: 49.5 nm, 57 mi

Q2: 102 kts, 117 mph

Q3: 10.5 nm, 12.1 mi

Oh yeah!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jason, Sporty&#039;s has an E6B ap for 9.99 that you can load right on your IPad!  Works great and I got all three answers.

		<description><![CDATA[Yahoo I got them all right. The only kicker is I have been using an E6B for 28 years. I have never used or owned an electronic calculator. Batteries are bad for the environment and they always run out of juice when you want to calculate in the air. One other thing I do is on question #2 for the wind and groundspeed I do this: I put my grommet (hole) on 100 and draw a line with my pencil or fine point washable crayola marker from the hole up and at the wind speed draw a little line. It looks like an airplane. Then I twist based on the true course. You then put the where the line meets the wing on your true airspeed and the grommet (hole) will be right over your GROUNDSPEED. I am visual and this is something I teach my students and when I teach groundschool. Since I am a CFI I better know how to do the E6B. I do know where the E6B name came from. I also know the E6B showed up in 2 Star Trek Episodes. For all those who are curious check out www.wikipedia.org and put in E6B. It is a great story. It is great tool that is tried and true and has been useful since 1930. Happy Holidays everyone.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I got the 2nd one wrong, as my wind mark was on the 1st arc above the 110 arc.
Thought they were in 2kt increments, would have thought you marked the wind speed at 114]]></description>
