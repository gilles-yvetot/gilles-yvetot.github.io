		<description><![CDATA[Jason,
 
I just found your site and I am enjoying it very much.  I want to share my experience with light gun signals I had about 3 months ago.  I am a private pilot with about 265 Hrs. to date.  We rented a 1976 Cessna 172 out of N. Perry/Hollywood airport KHWO in Florida.  We took off from runway 27 L with flight following and proceeded east to the beach then north along the shore @ 500 ft. to attend a training seminar at Pompano Airpark KPMP.  Just south of Ft. Lauderdale International KFLL, the radio started to flicker as I attempted to contact KFLL tower advising our transition northbound.  I put 7600 in the transponder after losing my comms.  There a was a jet landing on 27 R at KFLL as we passed just beneath him ahead of his wake turbulance.  No sooner did our transponder go out.  There we were in a heavy traffic area, no radio and no transponder.  Talk about tense.  As we approached KPMP, I turned west, rocked my wings while passing the tower and tried to go further west to maybe try and fix the problem and/or get my portable transceiver up and working.  Wouldn&#039;t you know it, Murphy&#039;s Law was in play and the transceiver had dead batteries; even I though I put them in the night before.  The switch may had inadvertinently been turned on and it was on all night.  But anyway, we turned east again and entered the downwind for runway 28 thinking we just left off RWY 27, KFLL was landing RWY 27, so the wind must still be blowing out of the west.  WRONG!  As I approached without flaps (electrical), I rocked my wings again trying to get the attention of the KPMP tower to get light gun signals, but to no avail.   I landed safely with a 12 kt. tailwind at KPMP.  As I got out of the plane a little upset for not getting any signals, I called the tower.  He told me that he did not see me and that the wind had just shifted and they were using RWY 10 instead .  Luckily there wasn&#039;t anybody coming the other way.  It turned out that the electrical system had failed prematurely not allowing any time to secure a radio call or to give a position via the transponder.  Was there anything I could have done differently that I could put in my bags of tricks if this should happen again?  Please fell free to use my experience to pass along to your students - not to t@facebook-100000260194841:disqus ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[How far out can you see light gun signals?  The question came up when we were discussing that VASIs are visible 3-5 miles in the day and up to 20 miles at night and we were wondering - but couldn&#039;t find - how far out light gun signals are visible.  Can you enlighten us?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[hey there,
I have never had this kind of situation and i understand it is tottaly diferent when you are in such a situation rather than simulating in the checks. thanks for tipping that i cud have it noted in my knee pad during line flying.

Regards,
Deepu from Nepal.

p.s. u cud incorporate some real lights flashing or steady to make this clip more lively and real.

		<description><![CDATA[haha great questions mike!

Here&#039;s the answers...

1.) Typically when an intercom fails the radio will still work although you won&#039;t here yourself (the sidetone) what happened is the wires were shorting out the entire system so it was a pickle.

2.) Sure do have a handheld but it doesn&#039;t do too well when it takes 8 AA batteries and I only had 4 good ones :(

Lesson learned

		<description><![CDATA[I have a couple of questions for you.

1) Was it just the intercom circuit breaker popping?  Are your radios on the same circuit?  I was under the impression that usually the radios had their own circuit.  I remember doing solo landing practice once without the intercom once, due to it being removed after being fried by a power spike.  It was weird not being able to hear myself when talking; it made me think the radios were broke too.

2) I thought you owned a handheld.  I think I remember you mentioning that in an old &#039;what&#039;s in your flight bag&#039; post.  Did you get rid of it?]]></description>

Great ideas man! You&#039;re spot on! That adapter is a big help when it comes to using a handheld in the air.

Great comment!

		<description><![CDATA[I ferried a C172 in need of radio-repair from what was known at the time as an &quot;Airport Traffic Area &quot; a.k.a. Delta airspace before the (Part Time) ATCT opened in the morning.

Squawking 7600, I departed the D-space airport for an arrival at an non-controlled airport using a hand-held (receiver only) for traffic-monitoring. I observed traffic-flow, entered pattern, and landed without incidence.

No &quot;gunfire&quot; on that flight but, I&#039;ve had the light-codes memorized with a copy on my knee-board.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jason, I bought a hand held radio off of ebay and **always** carry it with some extra batteries in my backpack I take on the plane with me. The importance of this was stressed when I was flying with a friend and both radios went dead. Even though we were over 30 miles out, the tower could hear us over the engine sound in the plane and cleared us to land. Since then, I&#039;ve bought a headset adaptor, so I don&#039;t have to take my headset off. 

Most knee boards also have the light signals printed somewhere. 

What does everyone bring with them when flying? Maybe that would be a good topic to cover if you haven&#039;t already.

		<description><![CDATA[I heard a friend of mine had a radio failure recently.  I have not had the time to talk to him directly, but myself and another pilot started betting that he did or did not know to set his transponder, whether he knew his light signals,  etc.  We also both mentioned that we both bring a hand held radio with us and wondered if our friend did or not.  Once I talk to my 7600 friend, I will let you know who won the bets.  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My instructor gave me a real world experience with this.  During my training the C152 radios quit working.  After landing, he asked if I wanted to take the plane to get it fixed.  I said sure!  So one of my solo cross countries was flown with only a hand held radio into an airport surrounded by Class D airspace.  Before I took off we extensively discussed the flight and reviewed the light gun signals.  It was my first experience with Class D (I had flon into Class C), and it was an awesome learning experience!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Brad smart idea! It&#039;s great to practice your light gun signals so you see them before you&#039;re dealing with them in a real life scenario.

Two radio&#039;s wouldn&#039;t have helped me because it was the actual intercom unit that went. Thus rendering ANY communications INOP. Now a handheld.... that would have been handy.

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Mike!

You&#039;re exactly right! You can&#039;t rely on Oh, it&#039;s on my kneeboard! You need to be memorizing some of this stuff! Thanks for the awesome comment!

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting situation Jason and thanks for the story. I carry a ICOM IC-A21 Transceiver with me but I&#039;m going to print off the Light Gun list for my knee-board too. I will be soloing in 2 more lessons and I hope during any of my training this doesn&#039;t happen to me. There is enough to think about up there already lol

Cheers,
Chris

		<description><![CDATA[Jason, 

Great video as always. I am a CFII MEI and constantly get questions about this. Sadly enough I think most instructors themselves don&#039;t know what to do because it is never stressed. The, Oh, well if it happens just look at this card is way too common. I am all for asking the tower to shoot the signals at my student in the pattern, especially at night, pretty cool stuff (they love it). Keep up the great work. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Having dual comm radios in the plane is nice, but are they on separate circuit breakers?  I honestly don&#039;t know off the top of my head.

I like your recommendation of asking the tower for practice.  This is something we all read about, but how many actually ever see light signals?  I&#039;m going to ask my instructor about trying it out sometime.]]></description>
