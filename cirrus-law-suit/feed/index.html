		<description><![CDATA[US in getting to a place where no one is responsible for anything. Lawyers are there to protect any and all idiots. 
Altho many things I don&#039;t like about the way they do things here in Mexico, I DO like the local adage &quot;hey we&#039;re in Mexico, SUE ME!&quot;
Until us gringos stand up to the legal establishment (members of Congress are mainly lawyers) and make them pass laws for serious tort reform and product liability, does anyone see it changing? I don&#039;t think so: too many in the US looking for a payday! ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Completely sick. Follows our societal trend to blame everyone else for our own failures. The pilot was trained, passed his written test, so he had plenty of info on the dangers of spatial disorientation and the dangers of flying into weather. Not only is the judgement wrong, the family should be forced to pay Cirrus&#039;s expenses.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is a shame - The result is more and more costly aircraft prices - better that 2/3 of the price tag of the plane goes to liability Insurance for the Manufacturer.  Just another example of our out of touch society.  We all must take responsibility for our own actions or lack of action.  Just like gun control - it not the plane it is the person who piloted it. ]]></description>

covered in the first days of PPL flight training. And then try to square
that with the assertion that another day of flying IFR (for a VFR rated pilot) in the Cirrus training would&#039;ve been absorbed.

		<description><![CDATA[Its bogus... I can understand how the pilot doubted the wx briefer based upon his local observation, and decided to go. Its something many have, and many will continue to do, often without a negative outcome, and in many cases, is prudent to do. Ie, if one is proficient at night flight, has an instrument rating, and is familiar with the airplane, and doesn&#039;t mind a return to base or filing IFR if conditions go south, its reasonable. In this case, the pilot had everything stacked against him, lack of experience at night, lack of a/c familiarity, combined with no instrument rating should have led him to delay, at least until sunrise, if not cancel from the get go.

Cirrus screwed up, by having the extra flight module in their syllabus, and then for any number of reasons, did not proceed with it. By the same token, that module would likely have had zero impact concerning this accident. Pilot skill is a replacement for judgment in some cases, ie had this individual been night proficient, had an instrument rating, and had 100 hrs in the a/c, he likely would be alive... but 1 training module on 1 day is not sufficient to build pilot skill to that level. 

For the average FBO, this lawsuit is likely to have minimal impact, short of an increase in liability insurance in the TAA realm. For those who provide FITS training for TAA&#039;s, I expect changes, either A, greater emphasis on MVFR, or VFR-IFR for non instrument rated pilots, or further pilot limitations, Ie MVFR or night ops prohibited without an instrument rating.]]></description>

Pilot skill is a replacement for judgment in some cases, ie had this individual been night proficient, had an instrument rating, and had 100 hrs in the a/c, he likely would be alive&#8230; but 1 training module on 1 day is not sufficient to build pilot skill to that level. </p>
<p>For the average FBO, this lawsuit is likely to have minimal impact, short of an increase in liability insurance in the TAA realm. For those who provide FITS training for TAA&#8217;s, I expect changes, either A, greater emphasis on MVFR, or VFR-IFR for non instrument rated pilots, or further pilot limitations, Ie MVFR or night ops prohibited without an instrument rating.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Its bogus... I can understand how the pilot doubted the wx briefer based upon his local observation, and decided to go. Its something many have, and many will continue to do, often without a negative outcome, and in many cases, is prudent to do. Ie, if one is proficient at night flight, has an instrument rating, and is familiar with the airplane, and doesn&#039;t mind a return to base or filing IFR if conditions go south, its reasonable. In this case, the pilot had everything stacked against him, lack of experience at night, lack of a/c familiarity, combined with no instrument rating should have led him to delay, at least until sunrise, if not cancel from the get go.

Cirrus screwed up, by having the extra flight module in their syllabus, and then for any number of reasons, did not proceed with it. By the same token, that module would likely have had zero impact concerning this accident. Pilot skill is a replacement for judgment in some cases, ie had this individual been night proficient, had an instrument rating, and had 100 hrs in the a/c, he likely would be alive... but 1 training module on 1 day is not sufficient to build pilot skill to that level.

		<description><![CDATA[I heard Cirrus is going to re-appeal. Hope they win. Why would a plane manufacturer be blamed for a fault committed by a pilot? In these tough times where established businesses such as Boeing, Cessna are firing hundreds of employees everyday, the fine will wreak havoc on Cirrus&#039; financial situation.

And of course, not only Cirrus, but the whole world is surprised and disappointed. My cousin brother drove real slow and nice in his driving license exam and his instructor was more than satisfied. He got the license, and then one night he couldn&#039;t resist the temptation to join in a street-race in NYC. Two cars were wiped off the face of the planet that night, and one of them was my cousins (he is alive though, but his driving license has been suspended)

Now would you fine the instructor and the car manufacturer for not training him properly? 

Was this guy a private pilot? It&#039;s not clear in this article.]]></description>
