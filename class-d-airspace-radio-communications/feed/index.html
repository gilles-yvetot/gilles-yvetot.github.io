My instructor has me now making the calls for a non-towerd airport and my mouth does not seem connected to the brain at that time!!!  Hopefully it gets easier.  Thanks ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Part of being a great pilot as you say, is also being a live pilot. When the tower, ground, or Center is talking, you should NOT be. Someday you may hear someone is at your altitude, your position, and if you are not listening you may become dead. I have been flying around the world for my entire career, and if one of my co-piolots started jabbering below 10,000 feet, or if one of my passengers in my Cub was needlessly talking within 10 miles of the airport, I would have their ass! You need to stress to the students out there, that one needs to pay attention ANYTIME there is talking on the radio. On a side note, send me an e-mail to my address, I have something you may like. This might be a good deal for you. I have been working on a book for over 5 years. It deals with the in&#039;s and out&#039;s of bush flying here in Alaska. All of the mistakes no one teaches you. Most of these, my friends had to find out for themselves. Send me your mailing address and I will ship it to you for free.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, I am a student pilot :) because i&#039;m always learning...


However I disagree with you on this on dude, you should always give a &quot;cold call&quot; initially to ATC. 


Imagine if I went on that entire ramble and they were not paying attention or on the other line handling something more pressing. It would be a waste and tied a tied up radio


And in regards to your last comment I understand a sterile cockpit but part of being a great pilot is tuning in and tuning out when calls apply or don&#039;t apply to you.


I appreciate your comment,


Jason

		<description><![CDATA[You made 3 contacts with ground before you finished what you wanted. Do every thing in one call, keep it short and to the point. The tower or ground is waiting for you to ask them what you want, there is no need to call them, get their attention and then call them again. Are you a student pilot???]]></description>
