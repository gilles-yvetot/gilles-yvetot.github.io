		<description><![CDATA[Jason,
Nice video as always!  I saw your checklist sitting on the glareshield and I would strongly recommend against putting anything up there as they can sometimes move and be pretty distracting  especially on takeoffs or landings.

		<description><![CDATA[Once while training I tried to slow down to Vx after takeoff (allowed the the speed to accelerate  faster than POH recommended) and got behind the power curve.

		<description><![CDATA[The power breaking is for 2 reasons. The first is maximum performance. I want that engine at full RPM and ready to roll nothing gradual. The second reason is I want to double check all my engine instruments. The last thing I need is to find out there is a problem when I&#039;m already committed to the takeoff

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting Steve!

Flaps or no flaps can be a big argument sometimes. I always say just follow the POH.

		<description><![CDATA[Jason,
Not sure what year 512R is, but the POH for my 1968 calls for NO flaps on high performance takeoffs. I&#039;ve tested it and flaps did hurt more than they helped. My old CFI argued that one with me but I have since learned to fly by the POH.

		<description><![CDATA[Jason,
      Big fan of yours!! That&#039;s pretty cool. Now with the after market flaps, are you still in Ground Effect? Also, I&#039;ve never had to do the power breaking on a Cessna&#039;s. Only on High Performance/ Complexed aircraft.  Can you explain further please?

Thanks,
-Jason-]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A piece of advice I received for a true short field situation is to mark the midpoint of the runway (or whatever you&#039;re using as one) with something you can clearly see from the cockpit. Then, on takeoff, if you&#039;ve not reached 75% of your takeoff speed by that point, stop. The idea being, you don&#039;t want to run off the end and that way you&#039;ve got the same amount of runway available for stopping as you had to reach whatever speed you were going.

Note: you must still always do the performance calculations.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Awesome video. Just found you through some of your YouTube videos and can&#039;t get enough.


One suggestion... If I had to be picky. The audio volume from intro, to segment, to flight isn&#039;t consistent. Is there any way you can make that smoother so I don&#039;t have to be on my volume the whole video? :) 

Like I said.. I&#039;m only being picky. 
Thanks again for your awesome videos!]]></description>
