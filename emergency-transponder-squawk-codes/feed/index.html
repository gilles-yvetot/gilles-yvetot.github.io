		<description><![CDATA[When I was learning, one thing we were cautioned on was not to &quot;dial through&quot; one of the emergency codes on the way to another transponder setting, such as:

You&#039;re using code 5700, then get instructed to squawk VFR (1200).  If you adjust the first number up from 5 to 1 as the first step in changing to 1200, the transponder will briefly be on 7700 and could trigger an alert.  

This may not even be an issue with newer equipment, where you change the code, then press a button to set it in, but it used to be.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Did you know, if you squawk 7500 then 7700 then 7500 then 7700 over and over... from what I learned, it means that youre beeing hijacked and you judge that it is better to destroy the plane ASAP in flight. Like 9/11, if the hijacker would have forced the pilot to crash on a building, the pilot should squawk between 7500 and 7700 and then just wait to be destroyed. I hope that someone like an ATC or somehting confirms with them before :P]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[just came across this. great way to remember them. The memory aid I was taught went like &quot;Hi Jack, can&#039;t talk now, I&#039;m on fire&quot; for 7500, 7600 and 7700.  The &quot;I&#039;m on fire&quot; part sometimes got substituted out with other emergencies, but I found the fire one most memorable. Only problem with mine was when I was just starting flying, I thought 7700 was solely restricted to fires, until someone told me otherwise.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great blog with lots of useful and interesting information thanks.
My instructor taught me &quot;ICE&quot; for transponder codes. 
In Case of an Emergency - ICE
I - Interference (someone interferes that is Hijack - 7500
C - Communications problems - 7600
E - Emergency - 7700

I guess it is important to use what works for you.
Cheers
