		<description><![CDATA[I typically don&#039;t give altitude unless it&#039;s for the purpose of terrain etc... Flight following is a privilege and I&#039;m thankful they&#039;re even doing it so I&#039;ll fly whatever altitude works best for them. I let the controller decide&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As far as the water bottle goes... Dude it&#039;s a 150 gotta make space where I can. It&#039;s wedged in there good. :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jason]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You should have told them what altitude you wanted in your initial request.  Then they wouldn&#039;t have had to ask.  Flight following is obtained from Dep/App control, but if Ground isn&#039;t busy they&#039;ll get it from them for you.  If you encounter turbulence, that bottle of water on top of the panel is gonna hit someone in the face.  It doesn&#039;t belong there.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great video Jason! It&#039;s interesting to see how different pilots copy down their ATIS and clearance. Daytona has some great controllers. How busy was 16 that day? I&#039;ve been 10th in line for departure one time when 16 got really backed up!]]></description>
