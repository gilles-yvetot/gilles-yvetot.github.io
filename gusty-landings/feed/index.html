		<description><![CDATA[Mr. Schappert. Thank you so much posting this video.
This video sure will help me for my next solo flight.
My home airport is always gusty since is located near from Gulf of Mexico. Then I experience some nasty thermos at the area. This video helped me to understand the power settings during gusty wind landings.
Thanks for the awesome video. It is very helpful and I would like to recommend these videos to my friends at flight school. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey guys.  I do enjoy the videos but PLEASE use those shoulder harnesses.  They can make the difference between a broken neck, facial injury and a crushed chest in the unlikely event we all don&#039;t want to think about. Your a good teacher and young...stick around and keep up the good work.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jason, I found that often times when I&#039;m coming in with gusty wind that the airplane wants to ballon all the way down the runway. I&#039;ve had to do a go-around too many times﻿ on account of it. Any suggestions?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I thoroughly enjoy your videos.  One of the hardest problems I had learning gusty/strong wind landings was to fly the aircraft until it won&#039;t fly anymore.  I had (have) a tendancy to associate my groundspeed (visual) with landing time, when my airspeed is still high enough to keep it off the ground.  I am beating that tendancy, but I still have to remind myself on final.
I enjoy all the comments too, which give me other ways to think about these topics.  Keep it up!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First off...thanks for the video. I don&#039;t get a chance to fly with a lot of other pilots so I really look forward to your video clips as a learning tool. I&#039;m a newer pilot...about 75 hours. And while I  received most of my training from one instructor I have worked with 5 different instructors both during and post license. I feel it offers me different perspectives. My question...I was recently working on some engine out in the pattern training and while slipping the plane to hit my numbers I floated well past my intended touchdown. I would have made the runway but probably would have lost my tires. As we were going around the instructor said I missed my touchdown because I was slipping with my nose into the wind instead of against it. He went on to say putting the fat side of the plane perpendicular to the winds (fyi...winds that day were about 10kts) provides improved decent without picking up air speed. I was always trained to slip with my nose into the wind. What are your thoughts?

Thanks,

Tim]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rick,

Maybe try it on another computer and check. The audio certainly isn&#039;t studio quality (it&#039;s the raw cockpit audio) but we&#039;re use to listening to audio through headsets as pilots

I&#039;m so glad to hear first you&#039;re ok and second that you&#039;re back in the saddle trying it again.

		<description><![CDATA[Mark!

It&#039;s like I have a camera and just know when to post the right videos??? haha

So glad you&#039;re getting a ton of valuable content out of the videos and the books!

Keep on learning and keep me posted on your flight training progress my friend

		<description><![CDATA[hey hey hey! 1987 was only 1 year before I was born! I&#039;m getting old now too! hahahaha :)

In the video we did a &quot;modified side slip&quot; most of the way down. With in inconsistent gusts it was hard to hold it steady.

love your story Larry! Thanks as always for sharing

		<description><![CDATA[First a comment and then a story. Did the student first crab and do a side slip? I teach to side slip all the way down because it gives the pilot a chance to figure how much  aileron to use for drift and then how much rudder to keep the longitudinal axis of the airplane down the center line(I call this pilot muscle memory). I know gusty conditions make this little harder. I feel the &quot;kick out&quot; method happens way too fast for an inexperience pilot to be able to correct for the gusts and not put side loads on the aircraft. Flew in 1987(way before you were born) from KDTW in a Piper Warrior going to Jackson MI(KJXN). Door popped open over KARB winds 240 at 20 knots and landed. Runway at KARB 24/06. Had breakfast. Took off from KARB winds 260 at 18 Knots. Called DTW tower winds 270 at 25 knots gusting to 45 knots. Wind shear alert in effect, Boeing 747 on final reported losing 15 knots. Tower asked if I wanted to declare an emergency replied negative. On final to Runway 23 Center had no flaps in, carrying 80 knot airspeed, airplane heading 270 tracking 230 down on final. Did a kick out with full right aileron full left rudder and did a squeaker on the centerline. Said a prayer to Mr. Piper and taxied to the hanger. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hmm, that was ALMOST timely. I just got back from my first dual x-c in less than ideal conditions, we were under an Airmet Tango all day and when we arrived back at home we had 16G24 but at least only 20 degrees off the runway heading. I knew to use minimal flaps and more speed but I wasn&#039;t really prepared for the ballooning that the gusts would cause, every time I tried to flare we&#039;d almost touch down and then pop up like toast out of a toaster. On the third try I just set it down a little flat and then hauled back to take the weight off the nose wheel. Lucky I had 5000&#039; of runway to put our little 152 down on :p 

Jason, thanks for sharing your expertise. I just started reading your checkride book purchased during your &quot;wedding special&quot; and it&#039;s a great review and resource and I&#039;m sure it will be a big help to me. 

For those having trouble viewing Jason&#039;s videos, let me tell you that I have watched them both at home and at work on vastly different computers and internet connections with no problems. As an IT support professional I recommend checking your computers for malware and evaluating the efficiency of your internet connection. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was on my 150 mile Solo Cross Country with gusts of 17 knots.  My first attempt I was too high and did a great go around.  The next attempt I put full flaps, slowed it to a &quot;short field&quot; landing speed and touched down ever so slightly.  WHOSH!  The plane was picked up and I was skidding off the runway and made a sudden exit to the taxiway.  Before I knew what was happening, the fire trucks were rolling and I was being interviewed by the Airport Operations manager... and a month later the FAA.  No damage to me or the plane - well, my confidence was shot.  I &quot;quit&quot; flight school that day... for about 2 weeks, but now I am wiser and prepared... and about a week or so away from The Checkride.  As I related that story to other students and instructors I hear time and again, &quot;minimum flaps and fast approach.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Have you had reports of totally garbled audio?  I love your videos, but I&#039;ve been unable to hear many of the more recent ones (say the last several weeks&#039; worth).
thanks.]]></description>
