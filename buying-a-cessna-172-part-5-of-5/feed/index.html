		<description><![CDATA[I have been debating witch plane to purchase as my first. I have gone from wanting a Stinson 108-2 or 3, Piper Warrior, Cherokee, 172, ect... It seems like the best thing is to find what you like to fly and then consider which will have a better resale in the future... cause I know I&#039;ll want to step it up some day. Maybe even get a Cirrus SR22 Turbo in 20 years... they&#039;ll be more affordable by then. :)]]></description>
