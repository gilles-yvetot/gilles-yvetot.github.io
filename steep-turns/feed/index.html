		<description><![CDATA[Good video, I will see if this helps my student, not that I have not been instructing him in exactly these three things. Having said that I have noticed another reason more often than not why a student fails to get these steep turns and just about anything else while there learning, as is the case with my student. 1) They are holding the controls with the Vulcan Death Grip and as a consequence of that. 2) They will never be able to realize  the very small pressures it takes to control the plane and they either won&#039;t do anything or over-imput.  Crucial for them to relax and loosen up prior to them attempting any of this stuff. I always give them after we leave the terminal airspace about 5 min of them flying between 45 degrees either way no more than 15 degrees pitch up or down and no more than 5 seconds of straight and level flight initially so they can start co-coordinating and moving their feet and, after that we will get into the formal stuff. It seems to help]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Excelent Videos! Thanks for sharing Jason! I&#039;ve spent almost all evening watching your videos instead of studing... sshhh.. hehe
I would like to ask you... why if it is always &quot;the law&quot; pitch for speed, power for altitude... during this maneuver (steep turn) we are suposed to maintain altitude with pitch? BUT If I do that I would loose my speed... 
Do I have to &quot;play&quot; with power and pitch during the maneuver... ? ...that will not lead me to a constant speed or altitude... I am very confused. Please help.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My experience with trim in steep turns on C-150 and C-172 shows pro and contra. Pro is you spare some muscles to maintain the desired altitude during the turn. Contra is you spend certain time - however short - to trim before as well as to re-trim to what you need after the turn. What will you choose? I think it depends on the situation.   ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jason - just discovered you...brilliant dude...thanks.  I&#039;m no spring chicken at 37 but I&#039;m finally in flight training.  My instructor encourages a touch of rudder entering the bank to help reduce the nose slip.  Like you, he stresses proper sight picture...ok, so I have a tendency to follow gauges and not the horizon.  Anyway, the touch of rudder helped me this week and thought I&#039;d share.  Oh, and he also makes me leave the trim alone because we&#039;re eventually going to want to roll out level and it&#039;s setup where it should be.]]></description>
