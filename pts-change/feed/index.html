		<description><![CDATA[As you well know, an airplane can stall at any attitude, power setting. or airspeed. For years, all we heard about was approach (power off) stalls, and departure (power on stalls. The student should learn from the very start of introduction to stalls, the cross control stall, elevator trim stall, and the accelerated stall.  So, I am for more stall requirements for the Private Pilot, and not just the Commercial Pilot. Some say that this training would be too much for the student to understand, but my belief is if you give 150 %, the student will retain 100%. If you give less, the student learns and understands less. The accelerated stall is a killer of many good pilots who never had them demonstrated to them, or for that matter, ever done them.  I have a simple rule of thumb about NOT STALLING at LOW ALTITUDES.  This rule is: If you are at 1500 ft altitude or less, simply take away the two zeros, and double the remaining number.  So, 15 doubled is 30, the MAXIMUM bank allowed at this altitude should be no more than 30 Degrees.  If you are at 1000 ft, you should not bank more than 20 degrees and so forth. This rule is meant to keep the airplane flying clean through the air at low altitudes where  quick changes in bank and attitude can cause the accelerated stall and cause an accident.

		<description><![CDATA[I am all for the emergency descent maneuver for the private pilot certificate. It was a maneuver I learned for my commercial rating that was discontinued as a requirement. This is a great tool for the student pilot to learn and have in their back pocket ready for the whenever they may need it(engine fire, sick passenger, loss of an engine over a great landing spot). It also teaches great control of airspeed while getting down as quickly as possible. It teach it in a Cessna 152 as carb heat on, power to idle, once in the white arc full flaps and start a descending 45 degree turn to the left. This holds airspeed at about best glide and gets the plane down quickly, but in control. As for the accelerated stalls, I am not a big believer in making it a requirement for the commercial rating. An accelerated turning stall at 30 degrees maybe, but I think the trim stall when going around would be the most practical. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jason

I am a Private Pilot with about 128 hours and I been practicing Emergency Decescend with a friend CFII for a long time now, I think is a good thing , it will allow you to get out of trouble quick . I have a friend who is going for his PTS  soon and I am going to send him this link so he will be ready for this change.

Thank very much for the update.

		<description><![CDATA[On top of Emergency Decents for the PPL checkride....I think spin recovery should be added as well  (assuming the aircraft is in the utility category).  Most Private Pilots go through their training and have never seen nor experienced a spin.  Yeah you can go over the recovery procedures (PARE) until your blue in the face but until that student sees and identifies a spin...or the beginning of a spin...they will likely not know how to react until its too late.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, I&#039;ll be interested to see how the PTS say the accelerated stall is to be performed. If they limit them to 20 degrees of bank, they&#039;re not much different than a straight power on stall and they&#039;re not very realistic, as most people who will inadvertently enter an accelerated stall will do so at higher bank angles. And most people who do get into an accelerated stall will do so at a high bank angle near the ground and will not have enough altitude to recover regardless of whether they&#039;ve practiced or demonstrated accelerated stalls on their checkride. As for an emergency descent, there are a lot of different opinions on how to accomplish it and it varies with the airplane being flown. Given those variables and the fact that most practical test flights never exceed 2500&#039; AGL, at least around here, I doubt that most examiners will test it. They may ask &quot;what would you do if&quot;, and if they like the answer then may say, &quot;OK, show me that slip to the left&quot;, or whatever you described. Still, if it gets instructors and students talking about it, (mine did), that&#039;s a good thing. ]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, I&#8217;ll be interested to see how the PTS say the accelerated stall is to be performed. If they limit them to 20 degrees of bank, they&#8217;re not much different than a straight power on stall and they&#8217;re not very realistic, as most people who will inadvertently enter an accelerated stall will do so at higher bank angles. And most people who do get into an accelerated stall will do so at a high bank angle near the ground and will not have enough altitude to recover regardless of whether they&#8217;ve practiced or demonstrated accelerated stalls on their checkride. As for an emergency descent, there are a lot of different opinions on how to accomplish it and it varies with the airplane being flown. Given those variables and the fact that most practical test flights never exceed 2500&#8242; AGL, at least around here, I doubt that most examiners will test it. They may ask &#8220;what would you do if&#8221;, and if they like the answer then may say, &#8220;OK, show me that slip to the left&#8221;, or whatever you described. Still, if it gets instructors and students talking about it, (mine did), that&#8217;s a good thing. </p>
