				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did you know you&#8217;re not actually required to ever demonstrate a spin until you wish to become a CFI? We are quizzed all about them during our private pilot training. In fact one of our checkride examiners favorite questions is &#8220;What is your spin recovery procedure?&#8221; To which you reply:</p>
<p>Power Back<br />
Ailerons Neutral<br />
Rudder Opposite The Spin<br />
Elevator Down</p>
<p>(The &#8220;PARE&#8221; Acronym I mention)</p>
<p>Which we&#8217;ll demonstrate in this video.</p>
<p>For those of you that have done or will do spins one day you&#8217;ll realize 2 things very quickly.</p>
<p>1. &#8220;Most&#8221; general aviation aircraft are easy to spin but difficult to keep in a spin. You have to really do everything wrong to keep spinning.</p>
<p>2. Once you do break the stall/spin you gain airspeed VERY quickly and it&#8217;s important to not over-stress the aircraft (This is where actually most spins lead to accidents) Go back and watch the video from about the 4 minute mark and keep an eye on the airspeed. You&#8217;ll see we&#8217;re stalled during the actual spin so although we&#8217;re looking straight down our airspeed is still very slow. However once we break that stall watch how quickly we gain airspeed. Pay close attention to this and don&#8217;t test the structural integrity of your aircraft.</p>

<p>Last week as a part of our upcoming feature film <a href="http://flyingagainmovie.com/">Flying Again</a> I had the wonderful opportunity to fly one of the films stars Ariel Tweto who you might remember from Discovery Channel&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Wild_Alaska">Flying Wild Alaska</a>.</p>
<p>While taking a break from the film we decided to share with our <a href="http://m0a.com">MzeroA.com</a> family a great video clip on a topic I believe doesn&#8217;t get enough attention&#8230; Turning stalls.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve been talking a lot about the FAA&#8217;s changes from PTS (Practical Test Standards) to ACS (Airmen Certification Standards) I&#8217;m a big fan of the changes I really believe they are trying to make improvements to the standardization of our certificates and ratings. However one thing they haven&#8217;t done very well is keep the instructors and students up to date on what these changes mean and when they take effect.</p>
<p>Let me be your FAA liaison! In the video below I&#8217;ll share with you the changes that HAVE ALREADY taken effect for the private pilot written test! (Instrument Written Test Changes Coming Soon)</p>
<p>If you have a written test coming up or need to take one watch this video first.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;re an aspiring private pilot or a current instrument pilot. There is something to learn in this video. An ASR approach is a trick you need to add to your flight bag.</p>
<p>An approach surveillance radar or ASR approach is done in the event everything for you hits the fan IFR conditions. What if you lost your vacuum pump in IFR conditions? </p>
<p>You could request an ASR approach. The controllers actually tell you to stop talking and just listen. They then followup and say &#8220;turn right&#8221; &#8230; &#8220;stop&#8221; </p>
<p>This video is a little bit long but will really open your eyes to a new kind of approach you can add to your toolkit.</p>
<p>Enjoy and don&#8217;t forget to leave me a comment below &#8211; Jason</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the <a href="http://www.lxvairport.com/">Leadville Lake County airport</a> in Leadville, Co. The highest elevation airport in North America and a great place to teach you how I make my uncontrolled (pilot controlled) radio communications.</p>
<p>First off I&#8217;m trying to get in the habit of using the phrase &#8220;Pilot Controlled Airport&#8221; because truth be told there is nothing &#8220;uncontrolled&#8221; about it. I believe in this world where the media loves to sensationalize everything we don&#8217;t need to fuel the fire with words that to non flying viewers sound unsafe like &#8220;uncontrolled&#8221;.</p>
<p>One thing you&#8217;ll notice in the video is I do things just a little bit differently than most. I&#8217;ll share with you which calls and make and how/when to make them. I&#8217;ll also share with you why I NEVER say &#8220;Any traffic in the area please advise&#8221; and why you should ditch in from your vocabulary in exchange for more diligent listening and better radio calls on your part.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever flown what you believe was the &#8220;perfect traffic pattern&#8221;? Not too high, nor too low, airspeed is perfect. Then what I call &#8220;The magical gust of wind&#8221; which always blows from right to left across a runway pushes you just left of the centerline. </p>
<p>This is a story that 95% of you guys can relate to at one point or another. I&#8217;m here to tell you that even I struggled with this many years ago as a budding pilot.</p>
<p>Landing left of the center line is a common problem and in the video below I offer some advice on how to counteract it. Enjoy &#8211; Jason</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>FIRST EPISODE IS GOING LIVE THURSDAY MARCH 12th at 8pm Eastern!</strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;re trying something new. It&#8217;s called &#8220;Inspire Aviation&#8221; and let me explain to you how it came about. When we first hired Scott Carson our new Director of Sales &#038; Marketing we both noticed a glaring problem with the flight training industry.</p>
<p>97% of people who take a discovery flight never start their lessons and 60% of pilots <strong>WHO SOLO</strong> never go on to finish their training.</p>
<p>Inspire Aviation is a new platform to educate and motivate students through their flight training with great time and money saving tips. It will be a live broadcast each week so you have a chance to interact with myself and Scott. Enough of me talking. Hear what this is all about in Scott&#8217;s own words below:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I set out to shoot a basic almost &#8220;cookie cutter&#8221; type flight following video for you guys. <em>However</em> what happened was anything but normal. In this video I&#8217;ll not only show you how to pickup VFR Flight Following but also show a Flight Following Handoff, Change of Squawk Code, and a bit of a different format.</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is Flight Following is a WONDERFUL service. Yet many pilots shy away from using it because they simply don&#8217;t know what to say. In this video you&#8217;ll see me pick up Flight Following and hear the controllers throw a few &#8220;different&#8221; variables at us. Enjoy It! If you love it be sure to like and share. &#8211; Jason</p>

<p>Have a question about VFR Flight Following? Leave myself and the MzeroA.com team a comment below.</p>
<p>Just to Clarify:</p>
<p><strong>What is VFR Flight Following?</strong> Flight Following is radar a service provided to VFR pilots on a &#8220;Time-Permitting Basis&#8221; by controllers. If the controllers are too busy they will just tell you so by saying: &#8220;Aircraft calling for flight following standby&#8221; They may get back with you they may not.</p>
<p>Once on VFR Flight Following controllers will provide you with traffic and airspace alerts. In some rare cases they also help with navigation via radar vectors (turn right to 230) Keeping in mind that IFR traffic has radar service priority and that these controllers are truly volunteering their time to VFR traffic. So the level of service you may receive will vary based on how busy that controller is.</p>
<p><strong>Why Did You Cold Call?</strong> These controllers are some of the busiest in the nation. Making a call for flight following can be lengthy call that could waste a lot of airtime. Plus since we now know that Flight Following is on a time permitting basis. It&#8217;s good to make a cold call to get that controllers attention first and see if they even have time for you.</p>
<p><strong>What Happened When They Handed You Off?</strong> Controllers are in charge of sectors. In our case we were passed off from Orlando Approach to Jax Approach. Sometimes you simply get handed off from one controller to another in the same facility. What actually happens is the controller from Orlando called up the next controller at Jax approach and said &#8220;Hey I&#8217;ve got this 7159Q guy he&#8217;s VFR to OCF do you have time for him?&#8221; The Jax controller said Yes and to have 59Q contact me on 118.6. The Orlando controller relayed that info to me via a handoff.</p>
<p>A lot of times this is where you can get dropped from Flight Following. If the next controller is too busy. You will get the words &#8220;7159Q Radar Services Terminated Squawk VFR, Frequency Change Approved.&#8221; Words no student on a long VFR cross country wants to hear but now we know why it happens.</p>
