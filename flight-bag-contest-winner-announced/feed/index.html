		<description><![CDATA[Jason,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With my one experience with a blown main we had the same lack of control you described. I was right seat with a fellow pilot building cross country time and when it happened she went mixture out, throttle closed, full aileron deflection away from the blown main (full left with blown right) and full back pressure on the yoke. She used light braking on the left to hold it on the runway and we rolled to a stop fairly quickly. The braking was her way of steering, but i&#039;d emphasis LIGHT braking. Your thoughts?

		<description><![CDATA[Heh.  Some neat tips!  I like the one about taping the batteries together.  Not silly at all - especially if you&#039;ve ever had a handful of batteries and went, &quot;Now...WHICH ones are the good ones?&quot;  How come I hadn&#039;t thought about that?  This just goes to show that no matter how long you&#039;ve been at this (and for me it&#039;s been a long, looooong time) you can always learn something new if you keep your ears and mind open.  Thanks!]]></description>
