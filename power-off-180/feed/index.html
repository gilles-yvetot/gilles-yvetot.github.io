		<description><![CDATA[Great demonstration. For me this is not a commercial maneuver, but a maneuver I teach to all my private students getting ready for their first solo. To be used if they have an engine failure on downwind. If they completely lose power, CGUMPS, power to idle, go to best glide 65 knots in my C-152) and do a horseshoe approach to their aiming point (the 1000 ft marker is my spot). Add flaps once they have their aiming point made. It is another tool in their flying toolbox. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Awesome flying! Question.  Is there any secret to varying the amount of time you wait before turning base (counting to 10 in this case) if there is more wind down the runway. For example, counting one second less for every X number of knots?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good stuff! :)  My instructor taught me to do power off landings from the start. I usually, eye ball the turn and hadn&#039;t thought about counting ... good idea! A forward slip is easy to do ... just glance at  the airspeed to make sure you aren&#039;t too slow. Also it helped me to remember that the throttle controls the altitude. 

Another good video to watch is ... A Sarcastic View of Pattern Flying by AVweb&#039;s Paul Bertorelli. You can find it on YouTube.  It&#039;s funny and augments the info in you video. I only wish I could be as good a pilot as Bob Hoover. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Pattern altitude at my home airport 82TS is only 500 ft agl because we are only 2nm away from controlled airport.  For PO landing, when I am abeam numbers on downwind I pull to idle, I have to immeadiately turn for runways midpoint.  No chance for base turn.  
What would you suggest for power failure at the beginning of downwind with only a 500 ft agl pattern?  Turn immiate to land downwind?  Might roll off end of runway but that is better than wheat field.  Right?

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this video... I absolutely love practicing power-off 180s myself, even as a PPL.

Spot landing practice is a lot of fun and a great way to keep your energy management skills up to snuff!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have never heard of timing a glide approach, but it seems like a good idea.  I fly at a country airfield and my instructor gets me to do glide approaches quite often, they&#039;re a lot of fun.  I will ask him about timimng it next time I fly with him.

		<description><![CDATA[My instructor had me do this Saturday. However, he wanted it to be more a simulated emergency landing, so he added stress to the situation by talking loudly and making me question everything I was doing. Wow! It was really, really different coming in and not being allowed to add power if I was coming in too low. In the end, I realized what I needed to do and executed well. And the stress he added to the situation was perfect and made it feel very real. I am definitely better prepared for such a situation because of this drill.

By the way, Jason, that entire approach and landing was beautifully done!]]></description>
