		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jason,

thanks for the tip. Here in Europe the system works a bit differently, as almost all IFR airport now have Standard Instrument Departures (SIDs), which describe the departure route. This route can sometimes be quite complex. Quoting one from Geneva (by heart, so may contain mistake): &quot;Climb on GVA radial 226 until 3.0 DME or 1900 feet (whichever is later) then turn right heading 030 to intercept QDM 043 inbound to GLA, initial climb to FL070&quot;. This is all replaced by &quot;KONIL 4C Departure&quot;. So the departure clearance sounds like: &quot;Cleared to XXX via KONIL 4C departure, squawk 1234&quot;. In some cases the departure chart also includes the departure frequency... Different contintents, different IFR.]]></description>
