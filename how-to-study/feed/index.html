		<description><![CDATA[I passed my checkride on Feb. 8th.  The examiner asked a lot of questions related to aeronautical decision making during the oral. Those are hard to study for, because it&#039;s not memorization, it&#039;s learning how to think about situations and make good decisions. I&#039;d recommend reading all the stuff you can find on the web about aviation accidents, the accident chain, VFR into IMC, fuel management, etc., and get in the habit of thinking about how you&#039;d handle various situations. The other thing he really worked me out on was, like Jason mentioned, sectional reading. I did well, so he kept going until he found things I didn&#039;t know or couldn&#039;t remember, like what a National Wildlife Refuge looks like on a sectional (I DID know that you have to stay 2000&#039; AGL over them), or that there are little numbers next to Victor airways which tell you the distance between the two points they connect, which my instructor had showed me but I forgot by the time I got to the checkride.  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What advice do you have for new students who study at home for flight training, and when they get in the cockpit to fly, all they read at home gets jumbled and they get brain lock and can&#039;t remember a thing.

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jason, Keep up the good work. One area that might or might not be a problem in your area is using self serve refueling. Our airport (KIDI) is a full service only airport and none of the students were being taught how to use the self serve refueling equipment and the safety precautions to be observed during refueling. I discussed this with our flight school and the flight instructors and they have agreed to teach this to their students during cross country training to an airport that has self serve capabilities.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi MrRoB,
Actual IMC with a CFII is logged as actual instrument time and counts towards your required hours of flight by reference to instruments. I actually logged most of my 3 hour requirement during actual weather conditions as well as 2 localizer and 1 GPS approach prior to obtaining my private certificate. That time will also count as time for getting your instrument and/or commercial ratings.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jason,
I am trying to get a response to an apparent error in your w/b video, as follows:

In your W &#038; B videos, you calculated an incorrect moment for &quot;basic EW&quot;:1750 x 39 = 68250 (not 67375)]]></description>

I have been following your videos for some time now. A few months ago I finally got my private and now look forward to my instrument, any chance you put some videos out on beginner instrument lessons? ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great idea here&#039;s a question on Light Gun Signals... If you need a two-way radio in Class D,C,B airspace, why is their a need for a ground light gun signal for clear to take off? If you don&#039;t have a working a radio why would you take off? ]]></description>
