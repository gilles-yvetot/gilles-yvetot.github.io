		<description><![CDATA[Ok, at first I thought, meh it&#039;s just Apple&#039;s location thing, it can&#039;t be that cool.  But seeing the dot on the taxi and approach charts actually did end up really pretty awesome!

Too bad I won&#039;t ever have an iPad, just due to lack of use.  I guess my judgement might change after starting instrument training, whenever I decide to do that.

Dodge those storms down there today Jason.]]></description>
