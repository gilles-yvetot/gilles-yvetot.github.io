		<description><![CDATA[Did you notice a new symbol that has been popping up lately on sectional charts that is west of Bowling Green. Those symbols that look like a pole with a propeller attached to it at the top. Those are wind turbine symbols. BTW used the VWV (Waterville VOR) as a checkpoint on my IFR flight to Sporty&#039;s.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s also best to explain the reason for the lower ceiling of class E at 700&#039; as its for the instrument approaches that are typically there so the VFR guys will be kept out of the pattern when ceilings are low to provide separation with IFR traffic shooting the approach. It&#039;d be bad to pop out of the clouds and have conflicting traffic.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Excellent!! I see guys all the time going into class e airspace, popping out of the clouds, seeing the runway and then cancelling their IFR clearances and they aren&#039;t 500 feet below the clouds. (I am aware of 2 FAA officials sitting at KPLN (Pellston, MI) as a couple of jet jockeys (read that as ATP&#039;s) did this. I don&#039;t know what the outcome was, but I hope it was only remedial training, but I doubt it. And these are professional pilots that make their living flying. Remember the FAA&#039;s new slogan, &quot;We aren&#039;t happy until you aren&#039;t happy!&quot; And thanks for the great videos.]]></description>
