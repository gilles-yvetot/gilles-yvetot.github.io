		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jason. I appreciate all of your videos and your passion for flying. You truly are an asset to the aviation community! For this reason I&#039;d like to discuss your insight into Steep Turns. Maybe... to take a second look at this technique.   

I have concern for teaching this method for a number of reasons. First of all, I am a CFII, MEI with over 16,000 hours. I have been instructing in light aircraft since 1982. I love to learn new techniques and  have enjoyed teaching on round dials as well as various G-1000 equipped S.E. aircraft. 
I teach in the Anchorage area as well as in Charlotte NC.

OK, the bottom line is...your method is cheating your students by not teaching the basic airmanship skills of adding back-pressure in a Steep-Turn and then releasing that back-pressure when rolling out. The simple reason not to teach this is because some student (maybe only one out of 10) may revert back to that teaching when flying in the pattern or just sight-seeing at low altitude with a few friends in the airplane....then to make things easier on himself, he just adds a few rolls of the trim wheel and doesn&#039;t fly the aircraft like you and I were taught. The next thing you know, he does a low altitude accelerated stall which leads to a spin into the ground. Flying with your &quot;finger tips&quot; in this situation would not give you that extra feedback that you need if the aircraft is approaching an accelerated stall. Yes...it takes a little more work to hold that back-pressure during those turns. But what are the benefits of doing it without trim? Easier to recover from an inadvertent stall. Less chance of over trimming? Jason,You have 8,000 hours. I would trust you to do this if I were in the back seat of a C-182...but would I want to sit in the back seat with a PIC that has 100 hours doing this manuever while sightseeing?
...as one of your postings indicated. (his instructor said he didn&#039;t want him to use trim for steep turns).

Here is his post:

Cool, I&#039;ll try this next time I take someone up sightseeing in the 152 and want to do a steep turn while looking at something on the ground. However, my instructor felt, and I agree, that students should learn how to hand-fly steep turns, as someone said, because you may need to do one to avoid a mid-air, bird, etc, and there won&#039;t be time to roll in trim.&quot;

Jason, Please think about what  Mark C just said!!!!
That should be reason enough to not teach this method.


Jason...I can teach a beautifully flown ILS in a C-182 by just using pitch trim for any Vertical correction and a little light touch on the Aileron to control Lateral alignment on the Localizer....But, would that serve my students well? Wouldn&#039;t I want to teach them to trim the aircraft for a ~400 fpm descent on the GS and then make any corrections with small hand-flown Elevator inputs (especially close to the ground?) I would NOT want to teach trimming the aircraft for every small input.

Let me add another reason to not teach this. Don&#039;t you want to teach patterns that will transfer to most other aircraft your student will fly? Would you recommend this for heavier aircraft like a C-182 or how about a C-206 loaded up to Gross Weight doing steep turns?

I&#039;d be happy to discuss this with you further. I really think you are a gifted communicator and an excellent CFI !!!
Please feel free to e-mail me any time!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tried today and, oh my why didnt anybody teach me this trick
Before.. Very easy to manage the turn and nail it, on my 150 i gotta add power tho, i had the airspeed droped a bit.. Thanks again Jason, looking forward to more videos..]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jason thanks for the video, tricks are always welcome.. so..  tell me if this is correct pls and thanks.
1) tell your instructor your target speed is 75knots (c150)
2) clear to the side youll be turning
3) bring speed down to target speed from cruise
4) begin turn and simultaneously trim 3 times to the left 
5) passed the 30 degrees apply power (100 rpm) and back pressure 
6) get a fix oh the nose of the aircraft for reference during the turn.

is this correct?

Thanks man.

		<description><![CDATA[Doh!  I will definitely try this next time out.  Three left, four right...will remember.

My instructor taught me a similar one for best glide (C150) dial in 6 rolls of nose up trim and bingo Vbg.  you&#039;ll need to tweak it a bit but that gets you in the ball park so you can start looking for a place to land.]]></description>
