<p><strong>Jason:</strong></p>
<p>Good evening and welcome to MzeroA&#8217;s aviation radio where aviation meets the airways. I&#8217;m your host and CFI extraordinaire, Jason Schappert.</p>
<p>Today is going to be an awesome day. This is our first show at our new time on 8:00 PM Eastern Standard, I have found that works out a ton better for everyone else listening live and everything. If you guys like to call in, just call this number, area code 347, 8572307. Or shoot me an email at <a class="__cf_email__" href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection/index.html" data-cfemail="aac0cbd9c5c4eac7d0cfd8c5cb84c9c5c7">[email&#160;protected]</a><script data-cfhash='f9e31' type="text/javascript">
/* <![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t="currentScript"in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName("script"),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute("data-cfhash"))return t[e]}();if(t&&t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute("data-cfemail");if(a){for(e="",r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */</script>, Twitter, Facebook, you guys know exactly how to get ahold of me.</p>
<p>This week we have a very special guest on the line, who&#8217;s going to talk to you guys a little bit about getting back into flying.  I did a survey that you guys who are on my subscriber list are well aware of this. I did a survey finding out what do you guys want to know about, and we talked about tons of stuff. You guys who signed up for the webinars know some of the things we have talked about. But a lot of it was, &#8220;I hit a financial snag and I&#8217;m not flying as much I wanna be&#8221; or &#8220;I haven&#8217;t flown in six months. Where do I start? I just can&#8217;t pick up where I left off. What do I do?&#8221;</p>
<p>So I brought in the industry&#8217;s renowned leader in Ocala. I brought in Chris of MyFlightCoach.com. Chris how are you doing today?</p>
<p><strong>Chris:<br />
</strong><br />
Doing great! Thanks for having me.</p>
<p><strong><br />
Jason:</strong></p>
<p>Well good Chris! I appreciate it! Thank you so much for coming out. Like I said, Chris is with MyFlightcoach.com and that&#8217;s what Chris really niches himself at, helping you get back into flying. He does an array of things other than that, but this is his forte right now. So Chris, I&#8217;m going to turn the table over to you. Let&#8217;s start with the basics. What got you into flying? How did you get started flying?</p>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong></p>
<p>As a kid, I was always fascinated by airplanes. I&#8217;m one of the guys who was always.. as a little boy, I actually made plastic models, built them and glued them together, paint&#8217;em. I used to do all that as a kid with my dad. You know, that fascination grew. I got a ride when I was a little boy with a friend of ours who had a plane and took me over my house. It was just&#8230; I fell in love with it. By the time I was 14, I was involved in the Civil Air Patrol, bumming rides, you know. I had a friend of mine who worked for the high patrol so I get to ride in a jet or a helicopter sometimes. If he had to do a trip in a Chieftain, a Navajo or a Skymap, I just got all this experience in flying.. in riding, I guess, and I couldn&#8217;t get enough of it. Started on my 16th birthday, got my license when I was 17, and changed my major at first year from just plain aviation management to professional flight which has all the ratings: CFI, multi, instrument, commercial and all those ratings there.</p>
<p>Along the way, one of the things I got that was really exciting was when I was prior to starting college: it was some time in a Cessna 140. Looking back now, I would like to have that opportunity again. Cool airplane. </p>
<p>After college, I got away from flying. Life just sort of happened like it does to a lot of folks and I got away from it. That&#8217;s kind of where my passion has been, and I worked with a number of people as a CFI and gotten them back to flying. I speak that language now, been there, done that.</p>
<p><strong>Jason:</strong></p>
<p>Oh, definitely, definitely. So what exactly is it that you do now? You did mention flight instruction but let&#8217;s skip over your flight instruction and lead us into Myflightcoach. What are you doing over there? And in time for some questions from the listeners&#8230;.</p>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong></p>
<p>Well, Myflightcoach.com was born out of my experience coming back into aviation after 15 years. Some of you had a 6-month hiatus, I had a 15-year-hiatus. I was really intimated by that process, getting back into it. I knew I wanted to do it, I knew that it was going to be important for me, I had the passion, I had the burn&#8230; I was concerned if I could remember everything. Could I send my 38-year-old brain back up to where it was when I was 23? Could I remember all those things? Would the motor skills come back? I had a lot of apprehension about coming back into flying. And, as I have worked with people as a CFI at a local airport, I have found the same thing: I worked with a gentlemen who had been out for six years and we had a lot of the same issues. Put that together with what I was seeing happening in a lot of other sectors, where there is life and career coaching,or financial coaching or business CEO-type of coaching and the rise of webinars and the rise of multimedia, I realized a lot of people in the aviation sector are not making use of these tools. How could I connect with more people and help more people than just those that happen to stop at the local airport? So, MyFlightCoach.com is trying to tie together those things and answer those questions about getting back into flying among others and how did the process work. So it&#8217;s really more of a passion trying to help as much people as I can get back in the air. </p>
<p><strong>Jason:</strong></p>
<p>That&#8217;s fantastic, Chris! I think I would like to talk more about what you&#8217;re talking about. I got a few emails here, and we have a caller on line here. I&#8217;ll get to you in just a second. I would like to get to an email question right here from someone. This person, Chris&#8230; they addressed it to me but obviously they mean to ask it to you.  They haven&#8217;t flown in 13 years and failed to get their <a href="../home/private-pilot/index.html">private pilot</a> certificate. So where can they get started? Do they start from scratch or what do they do?</p>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong></p>
<p>Well, you know, when you log hours, your hours are your hours. The thing that I would really focus on: what stops you? I wanna ask that question really clearly. let&#8217;s get a good answer to that. What stops you? Is it financial? If it&#8217;s financial, we can work with what. We can solve that. If it&#8217;s something about the flying itself, there was something you didn&#8217;t get, there was a concept that was troubling you&#8230; maybe you got frightened in the airplane. Maybe your instructor did something that scared you and you just kind of let it drop. I would really wanna know, what was the issue that stopped you? Once we had identified that, I think we would just start from the last known position that you had or you knew what you knew that you knew. We build on that foundation. So, it would take some review hours and some preparation on their part. But I found like, I said after 15 years being out, things come back faster. I think what we&#8217;d be working with, with that particular person who would be trying to get over that particular hump of &#8220;I didn&#8217;t get it the last time,&#8221; you know, that sense of pressure&#8230;. just relax. We tend to put a lot of pressure ourselves in mind. We&#8217;re perfectionists, we have to be to a degree, but I want you to have fun doing it. Okay? Let&#8217;s pick up where you were, let&#8217;s build up on it and move out. Find those things that we need to clarify for you to be comfortable going on that checkride and, ultimately, more than the checkride, for you to comfortable operating as a private pilot.</p>
<p><strong>Jason:</strong></p>
<p>Very good, very good! I like to interview you, Chris, I didn&#8217;t even have to <a href="../askjasonaquestion/index.html">ask a question</a>. That&#8217;s excellent, that&#8217;s excellent. Oh, we have a caller over on line 2. Caller, how are you doing? You&#8217;re live in MZeroA aviation radio with Jason and Chris. </p>
<p>(line is unresponsive)</p>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong></p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;ll just answer the question.</p>
<p><strong>Jason:</strong></p>
<p>You must answer their question, that&#8217;s A-okay. Anyway, I have some questions for you and this is personally from me before we get to some more emails. I get asked a lot to do flight reviews and they&#8217;re not all really easy flight reviews to do. Someone who gave me a private pilot certificate or anything. A lot of these are people who haven&#8217;t flown in quite some time. They just take flight reviews just to keep their certificates and get medicals just for the same fact. They don&#8217;t ever do any flying. So, when I get these people, I&#8217;m thinking to myself, &#8220;Do I sign them off?&#8221; I mean, I don&#8217;t know. You&#8217;re in a pickle there. How do you handle this situation? You got someone who hasn&#8217;t flown in twenty-four months wanting a flight review.</p>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong></p>
<p>Well, I think the best thing a CFI can do in that situation is to lay everything out in the table at that first meeting. Look at the logbook, review the history, talk to the person just a little bit. Most of the times, folks jump into the airplane just to get it done. We tend to maybe go faster through the process. What I do, is I sit down with them, go through the logbook and talk about their last experience flying if it&#8217;s been twenty months or twenty-two months and coming up with an end date for that VFR. We&#8217;ll talk about that a little bit. If I see that, I&#8217;m alwaysvery  up front with them saying, &#8220;YOu know the FAA&#8217;s minimums of 1 hour ground and 1 hour flight is just that, it is a minimum. What we need to look at, is what&#8217;s gonna make you the safest and the best pilot.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had folks say to me, &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t wanna go through that process. I&#8217;m getting someone out to fly with me, whatsoever. He&#8217;ll sign me off after an hour.&#8221; That&#8217;s okay, maybe I&#8217;m not the best fit for them. But I think we need to be very up front and say, &#8220;Hey, look, if you haven&#8217;t flown in 24 months, that VFR will take you 3 hours of air.&#8221; Say that, and say, &#8220;Well, it depends&#8230; let&#8217;s fly for an hour and see where you are.&#8221; But we need to really&#8230; if the VFR is gonna mean anything, then we need to actually follow the guidelines that we&#8217;ve been given on that and not just sign them off. For me, an endorsement for me is, I&#8217;m putting my name on the line as a CFI. I am testifying that this person is qualified for whatever endorsement I&#8217;m giving, even if it&#8217;s a VFR. </p>
<p>So, I always say, if you&#8217;re not flying everyday and this is not a CFI or a commercial pilot or somebody, I usually state my personal minimum of 2 hours of flight and 2 hours of ground. I&#8217;ve kinda mapped out what I do with those 2 hours and we start there. I remind them that you&#8217;re not gonna fail the VFR, I&#8217;m not gonna report it to the FAA or anything like that. But this is about making you the best, most confident and safest pilot that we can have and I&#8217;m gonna partner with you in that. That about outlines my approach to flight instruction and what I do with MyFlightCoach.com. I use that word very deliberately. I want to be the coach here, and assist them in doing that. I think being very up front is the best way to go in that situation.</p>
<p><strong>Jason:</strong></p>
<p>That&#8217;s right. I see an approach I really have to take with it. The few that I&#8217;ve done&#8230; one is actually ongoing, it was almost like taking on a new student, like working them up to a solo. He knew how to do this, he knew how to use the radio and some other basic things. He hasn&#8217;t flown since the seventies, but he still had those 300 or 400 hours under his belt. It was just a matter of bringing them back up to the surface and help him get started, but he was literally&#8230;. an 8 or 9-hour flight review just before he got his confidence up. I was confident in him to a certain degree but it was all his head I was fighting. It was hard playing with those mental triggers of people like you said, who may feel like they failed and didn&#8217;t do it or they were discouraged, because the flight will take longer.</p>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong></p>
<p>You bet there&#8217;s a lot of psychology to it. My flight review after my 15-year break was 6 hours and that was in the air. I did several hours on the ground. My chief concern was, &#8220;Am I gonna be a threat to myself or others?&#8221; It&#8217;s like me on a golf course. You&#8217;d never wanna see that because it&#8217;s a threat to myself and others. I didn&#8217;t want that here and the flying. So it was very important and I think to drive that home is a VFR, for those that have really gone a long time between them so it&#8217;s very important. It may not be that you are not the right fit or I&#8217;m not the right fit for a particular person, and I think that&#8217;s okay.</p>
<p><strong>Jason:</strong></p>
<p>But here, you got such a good story because you have been there, done that, coming back from a 15-year hiatus. That&#8217;s awesome. People always liked to hear my story about how I struggled finding a decent flight school and found a whole bunch of poor instructors. That kinda helped mold me to the kind of instructor I wanted to be. That&#8217;s my story, and it&#8217;s interesting to hear your story and how you&#8217;re working with those people of like minds and like problems. That&#8217;s really exciting to hear, I think that&#8217;s neat. Let me look into another question and this one came to me via Facebook. This is going to be a longer response to this one because it&#8217;s kinda multi-faceted but it&#8217;s simply stated.</p>
<p>What do you do if you had a financial snag? Flying is expensive. It&#8217;s hard to budget for, people don&#8217;t always make the smallest financial decision. They wanna fly that beautiful glass panel when they start right off, when they should be flying the 150 or the Cherokee 140 so they are able to save some money first. </p>
<p>But what do you with a student who has hit a financial snag? What&#8217;s the best way to go about it?</p>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong></p>
<p>Well, you know, I was one of those students as well. That was always an issue right in there, never too far from the top of my mind. &#8220;How long is it gonna take? I&#8217;m not learning this as fast as I should and I should keep moving.&#8221; If you hit a financial snag, again it depends on what&#8217;s causing the snag. Has there been some situations that you lost income or some situations that you&#8217;re simply plateau&#8217;d out and you&#8217;re spending a lot of hours learning landings or whatever. I found that with the financial snag, what people do is&#8230; it&#8217;s sort of a psychological question. You&#8217;re dealing with numbers and hourly rates and things that are usually a lot higher than many people are used to dealing with, and it adds up faster than they realize and it catches them a little off-guard. You&#8217;d get that $350 bill for the two weeks&#8217; period, say, and it&#8217;s, &#8220;Aw, that&#8217;s a lotta money.&#8221; SO it begins to kind of work on them. </p>
<p>I think the best thing to do&#8230; a good CFI will do this, I&#8217;m glad to do this with folks in MyFlightCoach.com.. is to sit down and do the very best as much as you can for what it&#8217;s gonna cost and don&#8217;t leave it at the big numbers. That&#8217;s what people a lot of times do. They leave it at, &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s gonna cost seven grand or whatever, five grand depending on the plane, to get my license.&#8221; Don&#8217;t leave it there. Divide that up over a period of time and find out how much monthly we&#8217;re talking about because that&#8217;s where it&#8217;s gonna hit you. </p>
<p>And then I always encourage folks: &#8220;If it&#8217;s tight for you, be patient, wait. Save up some of that money so you take that pressure off yourself where you&#8217;re worried that, &#8216;Oh, gosh, I&#8217;m going to do another hour of touch and go&#8217;s.&#8217; You want that there, so be patient, do some savings, set your priorities and begin to work that in financially so that you&#8217;re not completely stressed out trying to make it work financially.&#8221; So plan your finances. </p>
<p>Another thing that you can do to save money on you flight training is to come to your lessons prepared. So if you&#8217;re spending 30 minutes or half your lessons reviewing things that you could&#8217;ve done on the ground then you&#8217;re drawing money away. Be sure you&#8217;re prepared for that lesson. I&#8217;d even rather have a student say, &#8220;Hmm, can we go tomorrow because I&#8217;m not prepared?&#8221; I&#8217;d much rather have that experience than getting up and say, &#8220;Oh, here we go, recapping this again.&#8221; because we&#8217;re wasting time and we&#8217;re wasting money, and both of them are precious resources to us all. </p>
<p>One more thing I would say is practice on the ground. When I came back in for my flight review, one of the things that I had to get in my brain again were procedures. When I understood, my motor skills came back pretty well. I could fly the airplane but what I get flustered on, like some other folks I worked with getting back into flying, are the procedures. I can remember step one, step two but three, four and five are a little fuzzy&#8230; oh, I remember how that procedure ends, seven and eight. So I just use a regular old flight simulator at my desk, and have the checklist for the airplane with me and I would just run through the flow. By the time I got to the airplane the next time, I had it. You don&#8217;t have to spend a lot of time in front of the simulator, just flying the simulator but use it as a tool to get your procedures back. You&#8217;re more prepared that way. </p>
<p>You know, financial snags when they come, often we panic. I would say, sit down with your instructor and see what you can work out with that. Do you need to reduce the frequency of the flying? Do we need to honestly take a break and do some more saving? Every situation is different but I found out for myself, that it&#8217;s a matter of planning ahead and I found that it&#8217;s one of the best things to do. So get back into it, save some, do a little bit of savings, get a few hours ready to go and knock those out. </p>
<p>The cost of flying is always an issue for everyone, and I always want to say, &#8220;Yeah, but compared to what?&#8221; If we&#8217;re talking about comparing flying to tennis, it&#8217;s expensive. But, I always try and make them realize, &#8220;Look at the privilege and the joy that you&#8217;re gonna gain from flying. You&#8217;re flying an airplane, stop and think about that for a minute.&#8221; We&#8217;ve only been doing this for a little over a hundred years in the whole history of humanity and you get to be a part of doing that. Every time somebody passes me with a $20,000 Harley Davidson, I think, &#8220;You could&#8217;ve been a pilot and have $15,000 left over.&#8221; </p>
<p><strong>Jason:</strong></p>
<p>That is true!</p>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong></p>
<p>Look at your priorities and say, &#8220;Wow, maybe I can wait on this or that and funnel into flying and get really intense about finishing that license and then kind of go back to those things.&#8221; Just a thought on that, not that I answered the question fully&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Jason:</strong></p>
<p>No, definitely. Definitely, that&#8217;s wonderful. Chris, I&#8217;m going to sort through some emails here while we have a quick commercial break. Just hang in there with me, and we&#8217;ll be right back in a sec. Let me take some time to read your guys&#8217; emails so Chris, hang in there, everyone, hang in there, we&#8217;ll be right back. </p>
<p>(short commercial break)</p>
<p><strong>Jason: </strong></p>
<p>Alright, and we&#8217;re right back with you guys, again Jason at MzeroA.com. Hit me up at Twitter, Facebook or give a phone call in at (insert number) and Chris, I think you&#8217;re in big trouble. We got a phone call from someone in your area code, and that could be a big problem. Where&#8217;s your current office now? Do you want me reveal the entire number to you and so we can have another time to deal with this?</p>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong></p>
<p>Nah, just hit me and we&#8217;ll see what this is.</p>
<p><strong>Jason:</strong></p>
<p>Alright, so we got someone from Chris&#8217; area code and we&#8217;re gonna go ahead and see who this is. Whoever Chris&#8217; friend is, you&#8217;re online with Chris. How are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Caller:</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m doing good. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>Jason:</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m doing wonderful. What&#8217;s up, what&#8217;s your question?</p>
<p><strong>Caller:</strong></p>
<p>Hey, Chris, I don&#8217;t think you know who I am, but I feel like I&#8217;m putting off studying for my written. I just need to know how I could get myself ready.</p>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong></p>
<p>I think, with the written test, it&#8217;s all about repetition. The two approaches to a written that are helpful, kind of the long and the short approach. Most people go with some sort of prep where we&#8217;ll throw questions at them and they will learn the responses and hopefully also learn material along the way. They are great on this prep work and it&#8217;s a very wonderful time getting the test prep done so that you can pass the written. The other thing as an instructor that I find crucial is that sometimes, a bit of an issue is that we cant stop there with the test prep. We really need to know that material that is associated with that. We need to understand weather, we need to understand systems, we need to understand airport operations and things like that. </p>
<p>So, The best way that I found to study, limited to the written, is to use one of the software packages on the computer that will ask you the questions, grade you and give you study areas to build on. I found out that it&#8217;s the best, and continually work through that in your problem areas and develop a system. What I do with the written portion of my coaching is I use this prep where I develop a plan of action and try to watch for trims in the data as you take the test and try to say, &#8220;Okay here is where we need to focus a little bit. What&#8217;s the issue that&#8217;s tripping you up?&#8221; I found those things to be the best. I&#8217;m also old school enough to actually like to have the book in my hands. I often would have folks have both the book and the software with them so they can study along the way too.</p>
<p><strong>Jason:</strong></p>
<p>Very cool, did that answer your question for you?</p>
<p><strong>Caller:</strong></p>
<p>That did, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Jason:</strong></p>
<p>Oh, awesome. You have a great evening now, we&#8217;ll talk to you later.</p>
<p><strong>Caller:</strong></p>
<p>Bye Chris.</p>
<p><strong>Jason:</strong></p>
<p>Chris, are you waiting for him to be your wife or something? Because that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m thinking! I&#8217;m not saying who it was, it just came from the same area code. Who else could it have been? I don&#8217;t know. I got the number just in case you want to double check it later. Anyways, we&#8217;re coming up, we got about a minute remaining. Chris, if people want to get in touch with you, how can they do it and tell me a little bit about a contest you got on your newsletter? You got one minute, go for it.</p>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong></p>
<p>The best way to <a href="../contact-jason-2/index.html">contact</a> me is through my website, MyFlightCoach.com. My blog site is attached to that, called The Hangar. You can find a link on my website. With our email&#8230; we&#8217;re trying to work out building an email list. We are looking at giving away a book every week, so sign up for the email list and if you&#8217;re on that list, you&#8217;ll be in the drawing for the book. The book this week is called &#8220;Say Again&#8221; and it&#8217;s about developing good communication habits in your flying using the radio. So sign up for the email list, we&#8217;ll draw a name and we&#8217;ll get in touch with you, we&#8217;ll ship the book out to you. Check by next week, we&#8217;ll be doing it again.</p>
<p><strong>Jason:</strong></p>
<p>That is fantastic, Chris. Thank you so much for all you do that. Again, check Chris out at MyFlightCoach.com and, more importantly, remember a good pilot is always learning. We&#8217;ll see you guys later.</p><span class="et_social_bottom_trigger"></span>					</div> <!-- .entry-content -->
