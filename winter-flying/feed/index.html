		<description><![CDATA[Jason , I`m a new private pilot  ( less than 1 year ). I have 200 hrs PIC . Most of my flying has been in the last 2 northern minnesota winters. I have my own cessna 150J. This is my 2 cents on carb ice. Always pull carb heat ON after run up , pull carb heat ON (ASAP) anytime you have an unexplaned drop in engine rpm . Carb heat operation is fairly vague in the POH and differs greatly from pilot to pilot. Personally I pull carb heat on for any low to medium power descent until return to level flight. In the pattern I apply carb heat right after I announce turning base and leave it until landing roll.                                                                                                                                                      My plane is hangared always and has a Tannis heater for preheat . My personal minimum temp  is -5F any colder I do not fly.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just experienced carb ice in my Cherokee 235 this morning.  It was about 20F outside and 48% humidity.  I fly to work everyday in New Mexico, and I traveled before sunrise.  I set up for a long decent at 500&#039;/min under full throttle.   After defending 2000 ft to 7000 ft, I pulled the trottle back to 18&quot;, turned on the land light and fuel pump.  I then noticed the engine was loosing power, my first reaction was to switch tanks and richen the mixture.  This had no effect.  I then pulled the carb heat and the engine ran worse for a few seconds and began to clear up.  Here in the SW we typically don&#039;t deal with icing, but the humidity is usually around 25%.  I had no frost on the plane in the morning, but I was able to maintain 155 kts during the decent.  I don&#039;t know if this helped to cool the carb or not.  I believe that the conditions were just right and when I pulled the power back, it acted as a catalyst.  Any thoughts would be appreciated.  Also, we had very little clouds.  Clear below 120, no overcast.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tommy,

Never heard of such a thing... However what would happen if you did get carb ice on short final had to do a go around and the power just wasn&#039;t there?

I&#039;ve flown both engines and treated both the same. I&#039;m a big carb heat fan and have never &quot;induced&quot; ice by using it... Only prevented it

		<description><![CDATA[DUDE! The Airplane Is A Rocket!

No Really the 150 performs so much better in cold air

Think about what factors increase density altitude and decrease performance...

High Temps
High Humidity 

In the winter both are low meaning great performance!

		<description><![CDATA[Jason, thanks for sharing that with us... But I have a carb heat question pertaining to certain engines...I am at 60 hours right now and  I trained in a C-152 with a lycoming 0-235-l2c... My instructor told me to treat carb heat as  DE-icing equipment and to only use it if icing is suspected(such as dropping rpm or rough running engine) and to not use carb heat as ANTI-icing equipment as it can possibly put you into an icing situation if the temps and humidity are correct for this...   So using his advice, I never use carb heat on final approach.  I have been told by other people that I should use carb heat on final every time, but then I have to wonder if that is because they are flying a continental engine that is more susceptible to carb ice than a lycoming engine?         Your thoughts?            I am taking my instrument written next weekend and my instrument flight training  begins 1 week later near San Antonio,TX  ... I cant wait!!! Thanks- Tom]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the tips Jason!
I am very guilty of rushing my pre-flight because I&#039;m cold, I&#039;ll slow down from now on. 
This winter has been terrible in southern Indiana, it&#039;s set me back over a month for my checkride. 
Congrats on getting married, Niagara Falls looked awesome!

		<description><![CDATA[I fly in NorCal, it&#039;s cold usually. We&#039;ve had some 50 degree days, but usually it&#039;s around 20. The hardest thing here is getting the plane ice free. Thankfully we can put it in the hanger and turn the heater on for about 30 mins, then wipe the plane with a hot cloth. Only place freezing is over the gas tanks, just takes a little extra time to get it going. Great site and good thoughts man! I am only 16 hrs into flying, but love it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Brad!

Awesome story thanks for sharing!

and even better tips...

You&#039;re so correct to remember where the heck you&#039;re travelling to because the weather might be quite different.

Good call on the CO detector  I have one in all my aircraft!

		<description><![CDATA[haha Hey Brad!

Yes, Reducing cockpit bulk can be important (flying a 150 I know first hand) :)

However dressing to survive is vital.

Consider a compact space blanket in the cockpit or  few extra layers ;)
