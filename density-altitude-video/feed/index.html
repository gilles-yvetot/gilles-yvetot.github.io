		<description><![CDATA[I see. I&#039;d have found it MUCH more useful -- and the claim that &quot;all the numbers matched up&quot; more credible -- had you guys reviewed for us exactly what those &quot;numbers&quot; were  -- what-all went into the flight planning, what the margins were, and why they weren&#039;t adequate.  
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;I&#039;m a student pilot, and am still trying to learn this stuff.  Perhaps I&#039;m over-simplifying, but this seems like just the sort of &quot;checking the numbers&quot; that my flight instructor has me do for every flight.  That&#039;s why I made time to watch this video:  Density altitude is something I struggle with, especially since I fly in Florida where, as you say, it&#039;s usually not that big a factor.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Susan,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks for the comment. The teaching point behind this is not everything go&#039;s as planned. You can check everything and have all the numbers match up but still have a different result.&lt;br&gt;Why? Winds change, conditions change, the teaching point is you NEED to know how to make a go or no go decision. If the numbers seem close why push it? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jason]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So what happened?   what were some of the things he &quot;didn&#039;t know&quot; about the Bonanza? what SORT of additional planning would have helped?  what was the density altitude, temperature, gross weight of the airplane etc?  You guys seem to say two contradictory things: (1) Chris did everything right before the flight, &quot;everything should have been normal,&quot;  and yet (2) there are some additional things that pilots could learn.  WHAT ARE THOSE THINGS?    It sounds like he&#039;s blaming the FAA requirements for his problems?  From a teaching standpoint, I foud this video disappointing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tom!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank you! Thank you for being real and being you! Your opinion is very welcome here. I hope none of my words came off as harsh as you can tell from my videos i&#039;m anything but mean and rude.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You&#039;re right, there are a lot of what ifs? Your point about being an older engine is SO TRUE and one I hadn&#039;t thought of.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pilots should never be put or put themselves in a situation where they needed to use their &quot;skill&quot; that&#039;s for sure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The thing is SO MUCH can change one second you have a headwind the next a tailwind. The real point we need to drive home to students is keep their butts on the ground if it&#039;s &quot;close&quot; it&#039;s not worth it and I believe we can both agree that this video proves that&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jason]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your response.  Sorry if I seemed overly critical.  The key issue with this video, in my mind, is that clearly the pilot took off under conditions in which the performance of the aircraft was below acceptable safety standards.  He said that &quot;everything checked out&quot;, so there is a serious gap here.  Is he, for example, suggesting that the performance charts in the PoH are inadequate?  Or did he perhaps make a mistake in calculating weights or required distances considering density altitude, etc.  If the plane is older or the engine is not performing as it once did, this too should have been taken into account.  I just think it is unsafe to suggest that pilots sometimes &quot;just have to use skill&quot;, when skill cannot be relied upon to make up for inadequate performance calculations.    These kinds of dangerous performance issues do not just happen.  when crashes in similar situations occur, the accident investigations almost always conclude that the pilot either exceeded performance limits or cut them too close, relying on &quot;perfect&quot; conditions.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Let me also take this opportunity to thank you for your time and effort to provide this valuable forum.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dear Guest,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not criticizing you, just don&#039;t appreciate profane innuendos and &quot;tunnel vision&quot; which you&#039;re encompassing on this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let&#039;s start with where we agree... The pilot in this story is very lucky.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However you call this bad judgment... I&#039;d like to disagree. The pilot checked everything out and said it was good performance wise. He never implied to blame the FAA either you&#039;re taking a new media spin on his quote as if you were a reported for CNN. (doh!)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He said he did everything to FAA standards and the outcome wasn&#039;t so good. Is that the FAA&#039;s fault? Heavens no! He did the best he could and it didn&#039;t work out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now if he came online with me and said, hey Jason I cut some corners and really screwed this one up then we could be talking about bad judgment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The moral of this story is, the numbers don&#039;t always work out and these guys got lucky so maybe next time when you have a bad gut feeling about something however the E6B or computers tell you it&#039;s ok maybe or close... Maybe you should follow your gut. That sir is where judgment and Aeronautical Decision Making comes into play. Was his bad? Put yourself in his shoes&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#039;m putting my neck out there to make pilots the safest they can be. That&#039;s why we&#039;re sharing this video.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I appreciate your comments&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jason]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with the poster who questions why this guy is trying to convince us as to his &quot;skills&quot;, when he obviously blew his performance calculations and almost killed himself and his passengers.  The implied &quot;blaming&quot; of the FAA was the worst part.  And to the owner of this site, before you criticize me, I suggest you reflect on the importance of teaching pilots and sharing the REAL lesson learned here, which is BAD pilot judgement.]]></description>
