Hey Jason, I really like the way you explain weight and balance. Check your math the Basic Empty Weight should be 68250 you had 67375. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[hey airforce 1, the arm is the distance between the DATUM and the point of the aircraft where the pilot seats, the passenger, where the luggage goes etc. its used for measuring the moment of each item in the airplane and used to find out by calculations the jason talks about here to see if the airplane&#039;s CG(center of gravity) is inside its op limits.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[the &#039;arm&#039; is the length of torque.Â  for example if you push on a lever 1 foot away from the center of where it turns (the fulcrum) with 10 pounds, its the same (10 (foot x pounds)) as pushing on it at 2 feet away with 5 pounds (still 10 (foot x pounds)) ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jason, Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â  
Two excellent videos.Â  My stage 1 checkride is tomorrow, andÂ  the W/B sheet was beatin me up.Â  I used your vid to go thru it, and the numbers worked out fineÂ  (I used the numbers I was given, not yours).Â  Thank you and I will be signing up for my free 7 days and whoring your knowledge for all I can get. As a student pilot, I have learned that everyone has a different opinion.Â Â  The more opinions you can get, the better off you are, because the reality is somewhere in the gray area.Â  I watched your crosswind (flaps up) landing vid, and that helped a lot.Â  I have always thought I should save that last notch of flaps (even on a good day) because it helps maintain positive control on final.Â Â  I haven&#039;t found an instructor yet that is comfortable w/ that.Â Â  They are upset at my approach speed even though they should know that the last notch, combined with a tiny flare will burn up 10 knots in a hurry.Â Â  Just one more decision that makes me comfortable and makes them say that I don&#039;t know enough to make that call.Â  Do you have anything posted about using a GPS in training (heh, don&#039;tÂ  get me started)

Thank You,

		<description><![CDATA[Jason awesome video&#039;s! Â I have learned so much from this resource that you are providing to people like me asÂ an aspiring pilot.Â  One quick question though you said weightÂ x arm =Â moment shouldn&#039;tÂ 1750 x 39 = Â Â 68250.Â Â  How did you get that number?Â  Thanks]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ &quot;Trust But Verify&quot;!    As you said earlier you did this on the fly.  The  resulting numbers were very small and didn&#039;t make a noticeable dent in the end.  It is after all the concept that matters most.  Jason YOU ROCK, your way only took me two minutes from start to finish and I didn&#039;t need an asprin. I had always struggled with this but NOT anymore. Thank You ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[haha don&#039;t sweat it!

Thanks Jim!

All Math was done on the fly. As you saw and heard...

The main point I want to get across however is the concept

Once you know how to do it that&#039;s what&#039;s important

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Jason,  Anoter great video; however, my math does not equals yours?  I took our model and incorporated it into an excell sheet for future use based on your outline.  For the second video, the base empty weight of 1,750 x&#039; 39.0 = 68,250.  Based on your vid you show  a moment of 67,375?  The ramp moment is off as well?  I doubled checked with my calc to confirm my numbers Am I doing something wrong here?  I will be glad to forward my sheet to you for your thoughts?
