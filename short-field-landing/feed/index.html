		<description><![CDATA[Nice video as usual, Jason. Other than the carb heat (that I commented about a few weeks ago) this looks like a normal landing at my home drome!

Power lines at the approach end of Runway 26, though the strip is 3000 feet long so I don&#039;t really have to make it a full short field approach unless it&#039;s for practice.

That can be fun, though...
