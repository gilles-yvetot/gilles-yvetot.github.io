		<description><![CDATA[Hey Jason, 

I too had the same intimidation factor early on in my training. The majority of student and low time pilots do as well. My home airport is KGWS, and at an elevation of 5,916&#039; MSL, knowing how to adjust mixture is a huge factor. In the summer months, it&#039;s not uncommon to have a density altitude of 9,000&#039;+ MSL! I will never forget one of my training flights (w/o my instructor) when I forgot to richen the mixture after decending from 10,500&#039; MSL in to KRIL (5,537&quot; MSL) for a T&#038;G. After landing and during climb-out, the engine started to sputter a little and I just about crapped my pants! I immediately scanned the panel and noticed that my mixture was still set to lean. I pushed it in to full rich as fast as I could, and recovered from what could have been an engine out situation. I somehow missed it on my pre-landing checklist. Won&#039;t do that again! Moral of the story? Pay attention, follow your check-list, and become familliar and comfortable with the fuel mixture proceedure of your plane!

Fly safe!

		<description><![CDATA[I should mention that 50dF Rich-of-Peak (ROP) EGT as a recommended lean is pretty aggressive on the part of Cessna and I think they can get away with it because those engines are relatively low power and bullet-proof.

I did a quick survey of POHs, and I found that the Arrow II recommends 100dF ROP, the Cessna 182 recommends 125dF ROP.  Your POH may vary.

Just make sure you are at or below 75% power before leaning this way.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great video topic.  When I was learning to fly I did not lean regularly.  It was a component of workload, not really concern for engine performance.  I continue to watch your videos as a sort of continuing education.  I run a skydiving center, and we lean a bit differently.  Against the POH we lean during the climb (although we have an EDM 700 with all 6 EGT, 6 CHT, and oil temp.  We take off full rich with prop full forward and full throttle.  We don&#039;t touch the prop or throttle until we are at altitude.  Cooling is an issue in the normally aspirated 182 or 206 (because we are climbing at between Vx and Vy the entire time), so often times we cannot get to the suggested EGT temp before our head temps exceed 420 (and we don&#039;t like to go past that).  As we climb on a standard temp day, we begin leaning to max EGTs while keeping the hottest head at or below 420.  The leaning usually begins around 5000&#039; MSL, a little lower as DA increases.  We continue to lean in the climb until we are at jump altitude.  On jumprun (the heading at altitude for exit) we initiate carb heat and pull prop back to the bottom of the green arc (by now the MP is below 20&quot;) and close the cowl flaps (now we want to keep heat in to prevent shock cooling).  We use the throttle to maintain airspeed during exit.  After exit we close the door then begin a rapid descent (up to 2500 ft/min), slipping the aircraft to keep air off the door side and to maintain safe airspeed for the hull.  We do not begin enriching the mixture until around 6000&#039; MSL, and slowly enrich until we are full rich toward the end of our descending downwind leg.  On final we open cowl flaps and push prop full forward for a normal landing.
Our aircraft run very balanced EGTs and CHTs in cruise, but in climb do not.
Just some information so your followers can see there are other ways to lean an aircraft (for specific operations).  Using this method we can get 600+ hours out of plugs, and our cylinders last through TBO and beyond with good compressions (although from time to time we have exhaust valve guide problems...unrelated to leaning).  

Keep it up, I enjoy the emails and truly agree that a good pilot is always learning!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jason:

Brave of you to take on this topic.  I agree that Lean-of-Peak operations should only be performed in fuel injected engines, with balanced injectors and EGT indicators on every cylinder.  I was a little confused by your explanation of rich-of-peak operations, so I thought I&#039;d throw in my 10 cents.

The very first thing I would recommend is READ YOUR POH for leaning instructions.  Different aircraft have different engines installed and instrumented in different ways.  Leaning a vintage C172 is quite different from leaning a Cirrus SR22T.

The second thing I would point out is that cruise leaning procedures only apply when the engine power is in the Normal Operating Range (i.e., the green arc).  The Cessna 172s (and other fixed pitch aircraft) have a stair-stepped RPM indicator, where the top of the green arc changes with altitude.  If your power is set above the green arc for your altitude, then you should lean using takeoff/climb leaning procedures.  If your power is set in the green arc, you can lean using cruise leaning procedures.

In the video, it was not clear when you were talking about Peak EGT or Peak RPM.  These do not occur at the same mixture, so I think it&#039;s important to be clear which you are talking about.

Typically, when pilots are talking about Lean-of-Peak vs. Rich-of-Peak, they are referring to Peak EGT.  Best Power is typically 75 dF Rich of Peak EGT.  This is where you will see Peak RPM.  Again, Peak RPM ~= 75dF Rich of Peak EGT.

On climb, you generally want to be as rich as possible for cooling.  As you climb the mixture becomes more rich (because the air gets thinner).  If the mixture ends up too rich, then the engine will start to run rough; lean until smooth.  Above 3,000, you can stay ahead of this by leaning a small twist every thousand feet or so.  If your RPM drops when you lean in the climb, you&#039;ve leaned too much--richen the mixture until you are back on the rich side of Peak RPM.

If you need a high-performance takeoff or climb (high altitude/short runway), the POH recommends leaning to Peak RPM, but watch engine temperatures if you do this. In this circumstance, I&#039;d recommend not leaning in the climb until you are at least 3,000 *AGL* to allow the increase in altitude to make the mixture more rich and help with engine cooling.  Or if you find the engine getting hot and you don&#039;t need a maximum performance climb any more, richen the mixture yourself to help with cooling.

Let&#039;s look at what the C172 POH says for cruise leaning.  If no EGT, lean to Peak RPM and then lean further until the RPM drops 25-50 RPM (C172N) or 15-40 RPM (C172S).  If Peak RPM is on average around 75 dF Rich-of-Peak EGT, leaning a little bit further to get an RPM drop will put you roughly around 50dF Rich-of-Peak EGT. 

If using an EGT indicator, you can be much more precise.  Lean until you find Peak EGT (the hottest EGT temperature) and then richen until you are 50 dF rich of that peak EGT.

I think Jason was recommending simply to lean to Peak RPM during cruise.  That is actually a very good setting for engine longevity--better than the manufacturer&#039;s recommended 50dF ROP EGT.  Think about it.  Peak RPM is a mixture that is acceptable during the more stressful high-power takeoff and climb configurations, so it has to be easier on the engine than the cruise lean power setting.

However, if you follow Jason&#039;s procedure, you should make sure to increase your fuel consumption calculations during your flight planning.  The performance numbers in the POH are based on the Recommended Lean setting, so I would bump those numbers by 0.5 gph or more just to be safe.

On descent, the mixture becomes more lean because the air gets thicker.  If you do nothing, the mixture may end up Lean-of-Peak EGT.  We&#039;ve already agreed we don&#039;t want to be there, so you should be richening the mixture in the descent--a twist or two every thousand feet or so.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi Jason:</p>
<p>Brave of you to take on this topic.  I agree that Lean-of-Peak operations should only be performed in fuel injected engines, with balanced injectors and EGT indicators on every cylinder.  I was a little confused by your explanation of rich-of-peak operations, so I thought I&#8217;d throw in my 10 cents.</p>
<p>The very first thing I would recommend is READ YOUR POH for leaning instructions.  Different aircraft have different engines installed and instrumented in different ways.  Leaning a vintage C172 is quite different from leaning a Cirrus SR22T.</p>
<p>The second thing I would point out is that cruise leaning procedures only apply when the engine power is in the Normal Operating Range (i.e., the green arc).  The Cessna 172s (and other fixed pitch aircraft) have a stair-stepped RPM indicator, where the top of the green arc changes with altitude.  If your power is set above the green arc for your altitude, then you should lean using takeoff/climb leaning procedures.  If your power is set in the green arc, you can lean using cruise leaning procedures.</p>
<p>In the video, it was not clear when you were talking about Peak EGT or Peak RPM.  These do not occur at the same mixture, so I think it&#8217;s important to be clear which you are talking about.</p>
<p>Typically, when pilots are talking about Lean-of-Peak vs. Rich-of-Peak, they are referring to Peak EGT.  Best Power is typically 75 dF Rich of Peak EGT.  This is where you will see Peak RPM.  Again, Peak RPM ~= 75dF Rich of Peak EGT.</p>
<p>On climb, you generally want to be as rich as possible for cooling.  As you climb the mixture becomes more rich (because the air gets thinner).  If the mixture ends up too rich, then the engine will start to run rough; lean until smooth.  Above 3,000, you can stay ahead of this by leaning a small twist every thousand feet or so.  If your RPM drops when you lean in the climb, you&#8217;ve leaned too much&#8211;richen the mixture until you are back on the rich side of Peak RPM.</p>
<p>If you need a high-performance takeoff or climb (high altitude/short runway), the POH recommends leaning to Peak RPM, but watch engine temperatures if you do this. In this circumstance, I&#8217;d recommend not leaning in the climb until you are at least 3,000 *AGL* to allow the increase in altitude to make the mixture more rich and help with engine cooling.  Or if you find the engine getting hot and you don&#8217;t need a maximum performance climb any more, richen the mixture yourself to help with cooling.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at what the C172 POH says for cruise leaning.  If no EGT, lean to Peak RPM and then lean further until the RPM drops 25-50 RPM (C172N) or 15-40 RPM (C172S).  If Peak RPM is on average around 75 dF Rich-of-Peak EGT, leaning a little bit further to get an RPM drop will put you roughly around 50dF Rich-of-Peak EGT. </p>
<p>If using an EGT indicator, you can be much more precise.  Lean until you find Peak EGT (the hottest EGT temperature) and then richen until you are 50 dF rich of that peak EGT.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Jason, what you&#039;re saying makes sense. I was focused exclusively on the rpm changes and rich of peak since I fly an aircraft with a carbureted engine. After the rpms maxed out in the video and started to drop it seemed you were saying to adjust rpms back to peak. But to get the 25-75 degrees rich of peak we would have to enrich the three turns, or something like that, with a corresponding slight drop from peak rpm. It would be a guess without an egt. 

One other question for you regarding the leaning procedure sequence. Say you want to cruise at 2400 rpm with the engine leaned. Do you set rpm to 2400 first, then lean, then adjust power back down to 2400?

Thanks

Mike

		<description><![CDATA[Jason,
I fly a 69 Cherokee 235.  Do you suggest leaning in the climb as you move above 3000 and then properly adjust once you&#039;re at cruise?  Also, do I set the RPM and MP at crusie and then lean?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jason,
I love your videos and find them to be very helpful. I have one suggestion. Oftentimes your audio is difficult to hear. I would suggest that you use a lapel mic. I think it would greatly improve your audio quality. 

Thanks and keep up the good work]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Mike!

Early in the video I shared the differences between Lean of Peak and Rich of Peak and which situations they would apply. Keep in mind lean of peak requires an EGT to know where that true peak is. I&#039;m encouraging students to operate rich of peak 25, 50, even 75 degrees to the rich side of peak. 



Again without an EGT this is hard to tell however the RPM method takes the guess work out of it for pilot&#039;s without an EGT gauge. 


Even then an EGT only operates off a single cylinder. Who&#039;s to say it&#039;s really the hottest one? What if it&#039;s at lean of peak but you&#039;re starving the others?


And still Peak EGT changes every 5 minutes as atmospheric conditions change


Make sense?
