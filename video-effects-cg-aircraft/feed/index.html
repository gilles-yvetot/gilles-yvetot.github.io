		<description><![CDATA[Julien,

Thanks for the kind words! Awesome comment and question!

First off for those wondering Center of Lift and Center of Pressure are two terms used somewhat interchangeably.

What that yellow line in both instances is showing is the distance between the Center of Gravity and the Center of Pressure. 

This was done clearly to show a point. Or an extreme Forward or Aft CG. Never would such an instance occur in a General Aviation aircraft (I hope)  But I designed it like that to drive home the point and show the relationship and difference between the two.

So long story short you&#039;re correct! Very good point!

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jason,

Thanks for this video and for all the previous ones too, I&#039;m always learning something new!

I was a bit confused though by the part of this video that shows the CG in relation to the Centre of Lift (CL). If I compare the diagram at 1:56 in the video (aft CG) with the diagram at 2:18 (forward CG), I get the impression (looking at which direction the yellow arrows expands) that the CG moves from one side of the CL to the other. 

My understanding is that this does not correspond to reality, where (at least in common GA airplanes) the CG is always forward of the CL, which is obvious from the see-saw diagram later on in the video. Did I miss something?]]></description>
