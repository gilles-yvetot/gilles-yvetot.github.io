		<description><![CDATA[Thank you so much, what my instructor couldn&#039;t teach me, you were able to do that. You really made it easy for me. Some of your videos are not working for, I followed your text instructions, couldn&#039;t see the video. If you can upload them, that would be great. Thank you again :)]]></description>
