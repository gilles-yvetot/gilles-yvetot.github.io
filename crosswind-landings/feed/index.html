		<description><![CDATA[Great videos!
I have an idea for future crosswind videos. How about a yellow stripe (tape) on top of the glare shield to give a better visual to the crab angle, have the camera mounted directly behind  the tape. Just a thought. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jason, my instructor has taught me a technique where you put in the rudder and crab correction as soon as you get established on final.  Have you ever heard of anyone using this technique.  Is there any benefit to waiting until you are about to touch down before swinging the nose around to line up down the centerline?  Thanks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you, Jason!
But for me, as a student with no excellent English very important, that you speak fair and clear. And another option - text. In other side - difficult to understanding during the flight.
For animation - better to add view from the front - to see evolution with right and left weels. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Look at how well we mainained centerline right there... 

Not disagreeing with the technique, but drift is obvious before landing and you landed left of the centerline. Not impressed from a CFI who says they have the amount of dual given that you claim in a 7-8 knot crosswind.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jason,  thanks for all your online video&#039;s esp. these crosswind ones. I use to hate crosswind practice, but now kinda enjoying the challange. Your video&#039;s help simplify my focus.

		<description><![CDATA[Great video Jason, thanks for sharing this with the aviation community.  Crosswind landings are something I feel I need to get better at and watching this video is very helpful.   As a new pilot with only 61 hours under my belt, I can learn alot from videos like this.  Thanks.

		<description><![CDATA[Great stuff Sir. In Michigan the winds are NEVER right down the runway and that is the way I like it. I have my students on final use aileron for drift and rudder to keep the nose down the runway with no transition from crab to side slip. This gives the pilot a little bit of muscle and mind memory all the way to touchdown while making a few little corrections. I also first have them do a low pass over a long runway and hold above the runway to see how the aircraft and the controls work in a crosswind.

		<description><![CDATA[Grant!

You&#039;re right, nothing is better then watching it over and over then going flying and applying these concepts. You&#039;d really be surprised with how much you really learned once you apply the teaching points in this video to the air.

		<description><![CDATA[Jason. ...for me this would be like sitting in the right seat and beginning CFI training. The hand, eye, foot coordination plays a big role in the process of knowing what you should be doing in a cross wind. Watching this many times, plus the practical hands on is the best we can do. Thanks for this Jason]]></description>
