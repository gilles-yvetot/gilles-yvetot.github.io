		<description><![CDATA[Becoming pilot is not an
easy task as the trainees are required to join the best pilot training centers
from where they can learn how to fly the airplanes. The trainers first of all provide
the students with the theoretical classes after that they are send to practical
sessions.

		<description><![CDATA[ I am learning part 141 but I pretty much did my own ground school ( I used both Gleim and the Cessna courses together).  I do find many of the FAA questions a bit ridiculous.
I honestly did not really think about 61 versus 141 but then again I an doing this for me, not for a career.
As far as which teaches the better flying, I would be difficult to convince that the 61 versus 141 has much to do with it and it is instead down the the instructor(s) and YOU.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[hey man nice writing. I&#039;ve seen a couple videos from you on youtube about holds and type of entries I think and they&#039;re a really good tool for study. thanks a lot keep up the good work.
I did PPL and IR part 141 and was leaning towards doing CPL under part 61 .. ??]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great write. I did my PPL and instrument rating 61 but I most likely will go into 141 for my commercial. Probably a good idea for most pilots to do since they require way less hours that 61. Thank You ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It might also be worth it to note the differences in flight time requirements for certification vis a vis Part 141 and Part 61. Through your CPL, the requirements are less for Part 141 certification. Once you go for a CFI, however, there is no minimum hour requirement for Part 61 while their is for Part 141.

I went though 141 at a local flight school, 141 via a university (UND) and part 61, and relished the opportunity to fly in each situation. I do think that, in spite of the lack of &quot;book smart&quot; development, Part 61 trains much better pilots.]]></description>
