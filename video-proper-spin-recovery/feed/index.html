However, I&#039;m dead scared of a spin, how does one feel? I want to learn to recover from them but I&#039;m scared of asking my CFI to teach me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Erm, this is not correct -- have you not heard of PARE?  Power Idle, Ailerons Neutral, Opposite Rudder, Elevator briskly forward.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The order in which the steps are performed is important.  And you need to include the fourth step.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not sure it should matter, but I taught a spin and upset recovery course (along with akro) for a couple of years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not trying to give you a hard time, by the way...  but this is important!]]></description>
