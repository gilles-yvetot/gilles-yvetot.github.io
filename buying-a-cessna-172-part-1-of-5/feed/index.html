		<description><![CDATA[I liked your 5 part series on buying a cessna 172,  I have been thinking and looking for about a year now, and I have come to some rather harsh conclusions.  In a nut shell, there are too many aircraft owners that have the audacity to allow their aircraft to reach such a rundown condition that if it were an automobile it would be junked, but these folk  ask 40 thousand bucks or more....I have seen more ads for 172&#039;s with engines near or over the 2000 TBO,  interiors that your wouldn&#039;t accept in a $200 car, and paint that is indicitive of the care the aircraft has received over the last 30-40 years. i.e. left to bake in the sun.  Then there is the avionics, junk.  As far as I am concerned much of what is out there should be consigned to becoming coors cans.   Trusting your life in an aircraft that has been so neglected is pure idiotic.  And my message to owners is this, take care of it, or keep it, because I ain&#039;t buying your junk.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ Hi Jason, I have been thinking of buying a plane for a bit here. I am trying to think long term. I like the fuel burn on the 172, the ability to possibly add the 180hp conversion to it and the &quot;4&quot; seats works good for my little family. However, in the future I intend on flying into more remote areas, dirt strips and smaller airports. Will the 172 be a good start for this? Should I look into getting a taildragger instead if I intend on the backcountry more? I know i&#039;ll most likely fly into paved strips and I know I can land on dirt with the 172... Would this be  a good plane to start with and possibly stick with as I learn more and more?


Thanks a bunch!]]></description>
