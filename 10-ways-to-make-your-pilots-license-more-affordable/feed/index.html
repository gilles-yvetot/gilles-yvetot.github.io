		<description><![CDATA[Great points indeed! To make them more specific, this is what I did during my flying education:
- read the METAR/TAF everyday and explain the weather(forecast) to your partner in human lingo
- rehearse the radio calls of the flight in the shower.... also sounds are great
-fly the flight using google maps and your own jeppesen chart. Look for the landmarks
- start playing with flight simulator (C150 is great) combined with IVAO (rehearse the radio calls and make the virtual traffic controller sweat on handling VFT traffic)
- take a GPS with you and review your flight paths, altitude, etc.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;What if I told you I had a beautiful, well-equipped Cessna 150 that rents for $100 dollars an hour wet with an instructor?&quot; I would holler &quot;LIES&quot; at the top of my lungs. No seriously, I&#039;d be excited to find a deal like that!

Great points, especially the bit about chair flying. Nothing beats having the maneuver down mentally before even showing up at the airport. I have noticed that it students often nail maneuvers within PTS on the first go if they have good study habits and practice a lot of chair flying at home. 

Glad to see you promoting LiveATC. I spent several hours listening to this service when I went in for my instrument rating and there is no telling how much it helped. If you own a transceiver and live near a major airport, it can be fun to monitor local traffic while you&#039;re at it.]]></description>
