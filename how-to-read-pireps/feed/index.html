		<description><![CDATA[What you are seeing are contrails. Abbreviation for condensation trail. When a jet engine takes air in, it is compressed and ignited. The hot air, in excess of 600 degrees Celsius, rushes out the back and comes into contact with the outside air which is about -56 degrees Celsius. If there is sufficient moisture in the air, as the air cools it condenses into a &quot;cloud.&quot; This is mostly Ice crystals up his high, but they look like clouds to you and I from the ground. They naturally &quot;move&quot; based upon the upper air flow, ie &quot;jet stream.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The last few days I have seen many trails left by most planes high in the atmosphere, spanning from horizon to horizon. Are you able to tell me exactly what is occurring when this happens. The trails run north south, most of the time and drift with the wind. Any answers thoughts would be much appreciated. Thank you. ]]></description>
