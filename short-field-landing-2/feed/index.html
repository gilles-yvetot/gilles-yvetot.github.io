		<description><![CDATA[Alright Jason, I just started my flight training a few months ago and I can&#039;t wait until my takeoff/landing lesson. However at the airport I train at (8a6) the runway that is usually used for landing  has a final approach path packed with trees, so much that you have to idle the engine about 70 to 80ft above the ground. The problem is that,that is where you begin to float and the runway is only just over 2000ft. Do you have any tips on how to handle that type of approach, and how to handle the anxiety on that approach?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ Congratulations on your marriage Jason. :)

I didn&#039;t quite get what you meant in regards to the aiming point or maybe I confused myself... For example I&#039;m aiming right ahead of the thresh-hold markings ..What you&#039;re saying is to keep my aim a 100ft ahead or behind the point?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Jason.  What are you recommendations for a short field landing with a crosswind?  Say a 2500 ft runway (or less) with a 10-12 kt direct crosswind component.  Do you sacrifice a bit  control on landing by keeping in the full flaps or come in with less flaps and have to use a higher approach speed?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Jason -

Recognize the wedding picture - my daughter got married there.  Beautiful spot on Lake Alice!  I&#039;m learning to fly at age 64 in a 1947 Stinson (tailwheel) on a grass field (X55).  Every takeoff and landing is short field and soft field...like learning to drive stick shift.  For my night cross-country I flew a 172 from paved runways, and it was amazingly easy compared to the Stinson.  Once I master the landing in the Stinson I figure I&#039;ll be ready to fly almost anything.  66 takeoffs and landings so far in the stinson.  Hope to solo tomorrow!

		<description><![CDATA[I was recently endorsed to take my checkride for the seminole and while practicing a short field landing i had about a 10 knt crosswind from the right, to me i find it a little more difficult since i have to remove the crab and hit my predetermined point without gettting sideload which i sometimes do, not heavy but uncomfortable . any suggestions?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[On my checkride .. The DE asked me to do a &quot;touch and go&quot; with a short field landing clearing 50&#039; obsticle and transition to a soft field takeoff. There was a 8 knots tailwind component for the landing.  .. that was my excitement after I nailed it!]]></description>
