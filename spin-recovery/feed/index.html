		<description><![CDATA[Great post, thanks! Aren&#039;t training aircraft required to recover from a spin by design if the pilot lets go of the controls? Or is it just one of those aviation myths?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I also completely agree with this. As a student, we were required to do spins prior to first solo. I spent two lessons on them in the Champ, the first time my CFI demonstrated them and the next lesson I made a couple recoveries after he demo&#039;ed them again. Later on, in the 150, another CFI had me demo them during my mock checkride as well. And since I received my PPL, I&#039;ve gone out with my CFI to do some spins in the Cub - they&#039;re fun! :)

In all seriousness, I think it&#039;s a valuable thing every student should practice. At least one time while practicing power-on stalls solo in the 150 I managed a violent break to the left and immediately reacted... power off, opposite rudder. No doubt in my mind that the spin training helped. Until you&#039;ve been staring at sky and then, in an instant, the ground is rapidly spinning below you - reading about spins in a book just doesn&#039;t do them justice. Remember... PARE!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hmm.. Totally agree with the sentiment. However that&#039;s not a complete spin recovery - stick forward to break the stall tends to help too!]]></description>
