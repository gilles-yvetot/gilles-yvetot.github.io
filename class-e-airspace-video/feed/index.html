		<description><![CDATA[Jason
Your video was really helpful.  I am currently a Student Pilot and the E and G airspace has been bugging me for quite some time.  How about a quick video on G as well and how it interacts with E.
On other issue I have is I was told in my lessons that the &quot;East Coast&quot; has no uncontrolled airspace in other words no Class G.  How do you know that by just looking at the chart on the East Coast verses where I am in Austin Texas.  The E airspace looks the same blue or magenta fuzzy line.  If there is no G airspace and all airspace is E or higher, then why have the fuzzy blue or magenta lines around an airport on the east coast?  I think I&#039;m missing something?

		<description><![CDATA[For me airspace (assuming VFR flight rules) follows a series of questions:

     1) Where is it?

     2) What do I need to fly into it?

     3) When can I fly into it?

This video answered the 1st question. Not really that tricky.

The second question is pretty easy, just use elimination starting with the king of airspace, the Bravo.

     Bravo -- radio, mode C xponder and permission.

     Charlie -- radio, mode C xponder and radio contact.

     Delta -- radio and radio contact.

After that you can be NORDO.

Number 3 gets tricky and is the reason for the Class E. E just changes the clearance you need from clouds. As such, it keeps VFR pilots from running into IFR pilots even when the latter are flying IFR on a VFR day!

		<description><![CDATA[you did everything using an airport just about at sea level- it would have been better to show how to translate 700 or 1200 AGL to the altitude in MSL for an airport that is above sea level- like Carson City, NV for example- where the airport is at 4700 ft MSL- it is class E beginning at 700 feet AGL- therefore, class E begins at 5400 feet MSL- this can be confusing to some- In your rocket example, you just said it is in G airspace until 700 feet(but was not clear that in that case AGL and MSL were identical).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dude!! Thank you so much! I finally see the light at the end of the tunnel! I&#039;m about ready to take my FAA  written exam, and cloud clearances and airspace was kicking my ass, mostly because of the 700&#039; vs 1200&#039; class E transition. You couldn&#039;t have explained this any better! No fancy graphics, no unnecessary music, just a good analogy (the rocket ship) and common sense. Thank you!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I get the magenta shading.  700 AGL to Class A

Outside the magenta 1200 AGL to Class A

What about the blue shading.  It looks like that is also 1200 AGl to Class A.

Last.  How do you operate in Class E airspace.  Radio communication?  Transponder? etc.  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, You made what was confusing (and I&#039;m by training a physicist) simple.

By the way, as a ex-physics major I find the aviation terminology which is essentially about about air density, totally confusing: For example saying the &quot;density altitude&quot; is increasing in a scenario where the density of the air is clearly going down drove me crazy during my early student pilot studies (I&#039;m still a student pilot but further along and starting to adapt to this insane (to me) terminology). Maybe that only bugs folks with previous science under standing about gas  pressure, volume, density, temperature relationships. Curious whether it drives others nuts too?]]></description>

Why would there be a Class E magenta circle signifying a 700&#039; floor to the Class E airspace  (no bumpouts) around a non-towered airport which has no instrument approaches?  For example, look at GE99 (Heaven&#039;s Landing near Clayton, GA).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jason, I am brand new to your website at it is awesome. I am a CFI in Michigan and this helps alot with where Echo airspace starts. Most of my students are very visual and I use a balloon example. I am standing here and what airspace is my balloon in. I like the rocket ship better. Great work. I wish I came upon this site sooner as I am trying to get my student to his checkride by next week. He is a physician who is moving to Washington State in 10 days. Your book to pass the checkride looks great. Is there any excerpts from it that I can look at? Again thanks a bunch.
Larry Diamond CFI and hopefully this year CFII. 
P.S. Do you have any books for the CFII?]]></description>
