		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s worth noting (and others have mentioned) that often the best thing you can do if you enter a spin is to stop doing whatever you were doing in the first place. Modern trainers (i.e. 172&#039;s) are very spin-forgiving, and will usually self-recover if you just go hands-off as soon as you feel the plane get away from you. Even if you get into a full spin you can often break it by just giving the yoke a solid push all the way in. 

It becomes a much more dicey situation in other types of aircraft, and knowing proper recovery procedure is key, but the 172 will do everything it can to keep you from killing yourself. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When I got into an unintentional spin as a student, I remembered my Star Fleet Academy training that said to let go of the controls and let the plane recover by itself.

Luckily that worked, since I was only at 2500 feet when it started. Don&#039;t try this at home.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting technique, Jason. The spin recovery acronym that I used when training students was RCTRCT. That stands for Rudder, Control Wheel, Throttle, Ruder, Control Wheel, Throttle. Here are the recovery items in expanded form:

Rudder - opposite direction of spin
Control Wheel - ailerons neutral, yoke full forward
Throttle - idle

*After recovery*

Rudder - release
Control Wheel - as required
Throttle - as required]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jason,
Be very careful here -- the slip/skid ball is totally unreliable for determining spin direction. The turn coordinator (symbolic airplane), however, is reliable during uprights spins; the turn needle is reliable for both upright and inverted spin direction.Also, &quot;PARE&quot; is pronounced &quot;pair&quot; and is a trademarked acronym. It&#039;s use is freely allowed by others provided certain conditions are met, including the requirement that the acronym be applied in the same context as NASA Standard spin recovery actions, exactly as prescribed in my writings, for educational use only, etc. Other use is subject to review prior to publication to ensure that PARE is being used properly and accurately.I suggest reading any of a number of good books on spin recovery, but I&#039;ll plug my own nearly-500-page book here: &quot;The Light Airplane Pilot&#039;s Guide to STALL/SPIN AWARENESS -- Featuring the PARE Spin Recovery Procedure&quot;.

I am happy to assist in fleshing out the use of the PARE acronym in your training materials to ensure accuracy of use. 

Regards,

Rich Stowell (rich@richstowell.com)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jason, I was hoping for some spin video - maybe you should take the new cameras out and try some.

My first flight school required spin training early in the lessons. I literally worried myself sick that I&#039;d screw up and kill us, but I didn&#039;t and after having done spins I gained a great deal of confidence in my ability and the aircraft, and I found I actually kind of enjoyed them. What I was taught, is that when you enter a spin, the first thing you should do is to stop doing whatever you&#039;re doing to the airplane - neutralize the controls, and take a deep breath. In many aircraft this alone will break the spin, especially if it&#039;s not fully developed or you&#039;ve only gone through a couple rotations. The Champ I trained in would recover all by itself just by doing that. If the aircraft continues to spin, then gently and smoothly apply opposite rudder until the spin breaks - slamming rudder in can actually cause the spin to reverse. Once the rotation has stopped, check your airspeed, smoothly bring power back in, and gently raise the nose to stop your descent. But most importantly, always have sufficient altitude before practicing spins. A simple 1.5 rotation spin and recovery will easily cause you to lose 1000 feet. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, this is very useful ... I am involved with using UAV to probe active hurricanes. Readers might like to check out this spin and crash of the Global Hawk at China Lake:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byS2UcA1QKk

Now, as these craft have multiple telemetry links and two AF Colonels at the helm, the question is what really happened? Some have attributed it to a software glitch, but why haven&#039;t the other aircraft repeated it? Others think that the standard procedures do not work on sail-plane-like aircraft.  Note the GH has a U2-like flight envelope that is tricky to control. The comments on this video report this was a bank test gone wrong, but at $135 million a copy, it is very hard to believe. Roughly half the first 10 made have crashed. But no problem, DoD&#039;s just ordered $1B of these (yes, that&#039;s a B, we spent the money, now all we need to do is figure out how to fly them!) And it&#039;s not just this aircraft, here&#039;s a more recent UAV crash April 1:

		<description><![CDATA[Right on with what CLD said. Kershner actually had two turn coordinators, one on the left and one on the right side of the panel. The ball would show full deflections in opposite directions, but the little airplane in the turn coordinator ought to be right on indicating the direction of turn. 

I miss doing spins - they&#039;re crazy fun!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Various authors have indicated that the inclinometer is not a reliable indication of the direction of spin.  In other words, &quot;stepping on the ball&quot; will not always give you the right answer.  (Refer to Bill Kershner&#039;s &quot;The Student Pilot&#039;s Flight Manual&quot; or Rich Stowell&#039;s writings concerning spins, for example.)  Kershner found that the position of the ball during a spin depends on which side of the instrument panel the slip skid indicator is located.  This makes sense if the centrifugal force caused by the spin is the dominant force acting on the ball.  Under these circumstances, spinning will cause the ball to be &quot;thrown&quot; away from the center of rotation -- to the left if the indicator is on the left side of the panel and to the right if it is on the right side.  The direction of spin is unimportant.  (A merry-go-r0und provides a simple illustration.  It makes no difference if you spin clockwise or counterclockwise -- you&#039;ll always feel like you&#039;re being slung away from the center.)]]></description>
