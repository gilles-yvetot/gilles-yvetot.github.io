It&#039;s not until later on when you learn the importance of the preflight.  I had a great instructor who taught me early on about all the small signs in the preflight that could lead to big things during the flight.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was just giving a night lesson and we talked about the same things...we discussed how some parts of the plane are hard to see.  I now have a student using a ladder to check his tail since it was damaged and no one knew.  check that belly and you will see oil leaks.  Check the tail for cracks.]]></description>
