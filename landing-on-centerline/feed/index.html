		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;s a bit too generic and not valid for all aircarfts as it depends on visual perception and the observers (pilot) point of view. The width of the aircraft and of the cabin changes this perception. Basically you have to find your reference point (as with most of the flying...) in the aircraft you fly. In some aircrafts the centerline has to &quot;be perceived&quot; on the right shoulder but if you still land to the left, you have to move  you reference point more to the left, maybe in front of you or even on your right shoulder. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jason. Someone learning to fly in France sent me your link. Very impressive!

I&#039;m left seat on the Airbus A320 and it certainly raises an eyebrow when the F/O strays from the centerline. I flew the Airbus A340 for seven years and there was no way you would let it veer with a 198 foot wingspan.

Just thought I&#039;d say hello and keep up the great work!

		<description><![CDATA[Totally understand. You do however have to realize that when we enter into that transition phase you&#039;re in a glorified version of slow flight. The ailerons are just not as effective as normal. So to just say you must use more ailerons as a blanket statement isn&#039;t correct. It&#039;s a fine line of both. However every situation is different. If the airplane is just yawing left then you only need rudder. Yet if it&#039;s rolling left you need more aileron input.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think you missed the mark with this video Jason. When you get down low, yes, you use the rudder to keep the nose down the center line. However, as you get closer and slower and start to glide right or left of the center line you have to use aileron a lot more then usual, especially if it&#039;s windy. You hardly mention the ailerons, and the combination of rudder is the dance we are all trying to learn. I am working through this very problem, and no way you can solo if you can&#039;t keep it on the center line. It really helps to look further ahead down the runway just like you drive. As a student pilot I think I was trying to keep the nose of the airplane on the center line and that made me look at the nose of the airplane. Once you look further down the runway, you are having to feel and react to a much bigger picture and it seems to smooth things out. You can imagine how crazy you&#039;d drive if you looked only over the hood of your car. Not to mention the tension it creates which can lock up any rookie. The Vid&#039;s are great, you touched on it, PIC pilot in control, not AIC aircraft in control. Sometimes at we need to be aggressive with the controls and take the lead in this dance we call a landing. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m having the same issue, I just soloed, my touchdowns are pretty good, buy nowhere near centerline. I have another lesson tomorrow night I can&#039;t wait to try these tips.
Soon I&#039;ll be able to solo to a smaller airport that is untowered and has a much smaller runway. 
Happy Flying

		<description><![CDATA[I learned to fly in the early 70&#039;s out of a little non-towered strip with a 2200x30 hard surface.  By the time I had 20 hours, I could shoot a short field into a gusting crosswind, set it down dead center and have it shut down by the second set of lights.  But, when I would go to the local towered airport (class C now) with its 7000x150 runway I would be all over the place.  I would be off center. I would land with a little bit of a crab.  With a crosswind, I would have been more comfortable landing sideways on the runway.  With that much concrete, it was no challenge so I would get sloppy.  I found that I had to concentrate on the centerline as my target rather than the runway as I had learned at my little home field.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I learned to fly in the early 70&#8217;s out of a little non-towered strip with a 2200&#215;30 hard surface.  By the time I had 20 hours, I could shoot a short field into a gusting crosswind, set it down dead center and have it shut down by the second set of lights.  But, when I would go to the local towered airport (class C now) with its 7000&#215;150 runway I would be all over the place.  I would be off center. I would land with a little bit of a crab.  With a crosswind, I would have been more comfortable landing sideways on the runway.  With that much concrete, it was no challenge so I would get sloppy.  I found that I had to concentrate on the centerline as my target rather than the runway as I had learned at my little home field.</p>
