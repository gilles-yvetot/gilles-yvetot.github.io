		<description><![CDATA[Hi I agree with a simple thought on this.  My CFI taught &quot; Dive away, &#038; turn into&quot; - regarding taxiing in the wind.  Regarding the ailerons up and down position, simply raise your thumbs or thumb when your hands are on the yoke, when you turn the yoke to dive away or turn into the wind - which ever wing your thumbs are pointing indicates the aileron which is &quot;UP&quot; - Hope this helps and good luck!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was taught by my CFI was the easy way to rememeber, was whatever the direction the wind was coming from, it should always cut straight through the yoke. This seemed to help it be simple for me.

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Jason,

Thanks for the video. The day I was thought about Taxi in crosswind; I technically wondered? Does these Ailerons and Elevators works as described? (Been a Mechanical student and Computer Engineer) And Yes, makes sense. It works !!!

Remember Super Student pilots ; if you don&#039;t hold appropriate correction; your aircraft wants to wander around the taxi and runway center line. That means, more labor work, and less concentration on next part of your flying for ex: Radio calls &#038; takeoff roll..

		<description><![CDATA[Jack,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Great insights! You&#039;re correct day one is not the day to be teaching crosswind taxi, takeoff, or landing :) In fact cross wind taxi won&#039;t even come up until my student is taxiing on his or her own and navigating their way around the airports taxiways without a snag.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#039;s the little things that add up and get overwhelming. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jason]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is the same explanation of &#039;how to taxi in winds&#039; that I&#039;ve seen in a dozen other places. I think it&#039;s too &#039;high level&#039; for the beginner student, especially since taxiing is probably the first thing a student learns about physically moving the airplane. The student is thinking: &#039;dive away? ailerons? what?&#039; while still trying to apply pressure to the correct pedal and getting the right throttle setting and thinking about other planes on the taxiway and taking the right taxi routes and ATC and other pilots on the radio - it&#039;s a lot to take in at on time, and it seems like a lot of CFIs aren&#039;t thinking about how overwhelming it all is because it&#039;s old hat to them. And maybe they think that they&#039;re paying attention to the radio or to where they and other traffic are on the taxiways and don&#039;t think that the student is worrying about all that as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think a better first-time explanation of taxiing in crosswinds would be more along the lines of:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the wind is coming from [here], the yoke should look like [this].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Simple. Utilitarian. Makes sense to someone who is just starting to see what the airplane looks like from the cockpit, and what they physically do to control the plane. Then it would be easier for the student to sort it out later as to why, aerodynamically, that&#039;s how the control surfaces are held while taxiing in wind.]]></description>
