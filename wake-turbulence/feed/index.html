<p>You&#39;re exactly right a light quartering tailwind can make wake turbulence &#8220;hang out&#8221; longer on the runway.</p>
<p>Awesome points</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Wake Turbulence is a serious matter. Didn&#039;t Vanna White&#039;s husband die from wake turbulence at Long Beach or something?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think another note here is to realize the wind can &#039;push&#039; the wake. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, say you&#039;re going to take off and the wind is going from right to left and you have a jet takeoff before you. Usually it&#039;s prudent to depart over the runway, but in this case it may be smarter to &#039;dogleg&#039; to the right (because the wind should be blowing the wake the other direction) to further avoid the wake. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#039;m sure you knew this, Jason, but just wanted to point that out as well.]]></description>
