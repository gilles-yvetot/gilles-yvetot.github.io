		<description><![CDATA[haha Believe me I know, you will always have those headstrong pilot that are committed to doing certain things. He was a 172 making a 10 mile final for goodness sake! He had plenty of time to re adjust. This guy was just being inconsiderate.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It was interesting to hear the situation with conflicting traffic.  Why didn&#039;t the pilot approaching RWY 23 make a circuit to land on RWY 5, given the obvious conflict he was creating?  I realize there are sometimes operational reasons to use a downwind runway direction, does that apply here, or was the guy just lazy?]]></description>
