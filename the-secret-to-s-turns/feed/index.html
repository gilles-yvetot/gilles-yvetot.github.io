		<description><![CDATA[Since it is 25 degrees, Winds 260/25G33 and snowing here I need to feel the Ocala warmth. I
 teach S-turns based on 2 words: Winds and Groundspeed. If the winds are
 coming from behind you(downwind entry) faster groundspeed steeper turn. Into the wind, 
slower groundspeed, shallower bank. I have the student always enter on 
the downwind and before they cross the road I will ask and remind them 
&quot;where are winds and what is your groundspeed&quot; (fast or slow). Since it 
is downwind and the groundspeed is the fastest the first turn to the 
left will be the steepest and I want them to paint half circles over the
 top of the road. As they continue the circle back to the road the 
groundspeed will be slower into the wind and the bank will be shallower.
 Now is the really exciting part as they cross the road going into the 
wind, I have them go into a very shallow bank and say 1001, 1002, 1003 
and then start a little bigger bank. This keeps the circle nice and 
round and keeps them from going into too steep of a bank and flattening 
their circle like a pancake. Your videos are the Rembrandt&#039;s of aviation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jason, awesome camera angles and audio! Can you please make a video on where you put the cameras, how you mount them, and which cameras you use. If you can go over any tips, tricks, and any FARs I should be concerned about that would be awesome! Thanks]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That makes a lot of sense. So would you say the turn is always steeper on downwind headings and shallower on upwind? So if you consider the traffic pattern this translates to a steeper turn from downwind to base, then a shallower turn from base to final. Is that correct or am I overlooking anything here?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That had to be the very best S turn video lesson I have ever seen. It is spot on with the video views leaving nothing to question. Especially explaining the wind
directions in the maneuver. Once again your excellence shows. Wonderful job

		<description><![CDATA[Ok. At least one hand on the yoke while talking. Talking with both hands, and flying the maneuver perfect is showing off. Ha ha. Your camera work and instruction is the best. Very clear and precise and can be watched over and over to pick up the details.
