		<description><![CDATA[I agree!  My story relates to a sailboat my Wife and I owned in Chicago.  It had a sweetheart of an outboard, and since anything marked &quot;Nautical&quot; or &quot;Aviation&quot; seems to be three times as expensive for the &#039;equivalent&#039; automotive product, we&#039;d fill the tank with Regular gas from the local BP.  

Well, one day when the wind died and we were three miles from shore on Lake Michigan, I reached over for my lengthy excerise session at the stern of the boat (starting the engine before I installed a remote starter).  Cursing the fact I had to use the &#039;iron sail&#039;, I did in fact however breath a sigh of relief when it started.  

It lasted 10 minutes before we it quit and we had a small fire.  From my pilot training I&#039;m always safety conscious and constantly develop back up plans and I had the fire extinguisher working in seconds flat.  

After a LENGTHY row back to our dock (more contingency plan results -- have an oar!), we found that the hose that fed the carb had a big honkin&#039; hole in it.  A mechanic then asked me where I got my fuel.  

The rest is history.  10% Ethenol = 100% future failure and expense.   ]]></description>
