		<description><![CDATA[Don&#039;t think that mountain flying is only in the Rockies, I live in Knoxville, TN at the base of the Great Smoky Mountains which are almost 7,000ft high. We pull crashed airplanes off the tops every year. The major cause of accidents? NOT density altitude. The primary cause of accidents in the Smokies is VFR into IMC which ends in controlled flight into terrain. Also, strong winds are a major factor too but usually are in conjunction with IMC. Add to this that there are far more airplanes in the Southeast that have to cross the Appalachians to get somewhere, one could argue that the Appalachians can be far more dangerous than the Rockies due to population. ]]></description>

I don&#039;t know, but your mountain flying video did helped me a lot.. In all it took 21.8hrs in 2days.. &lt;br&gt;Guys, Every pilot should plan a lon cross country before CPL; believe me, I got first hand experience in Class C, D, E &amp; G while talking to ATC and flight following controllers..

		<description><![CDATA[That was a great video! Thanks. Passing it on to friends. Is it almost better to simply fly over with 1,500 between you and the peaks and wear oxygen? When in doubt of wind and density altitude I mean? Perhaps not in a 172 but lets say a 182?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Charles.]]></description>
