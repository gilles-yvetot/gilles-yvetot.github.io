		<description><![CDATA[One tip my instructor gave me that was really helpful in turns around a point was to pick equidistant objects around my selected point to fly over as references for maintaining a constant radius from my selected point.   For example, if I am making turns around a point and the point is a farmhouse, I would pick, say, a stand of trees approximately a half-mile from the farmhouse on the downwind entry, and probably at least 3 other reference points as I transition from downwind to crosswind that I aim to fly over.  I found it easier to adjust my bank angle with the help of this sight picture.  ]]></description>
