		<description><![CDATA[2 more I&#039;d like to add to your great list:

1) A good pair of sunglasses (think $90 up...and yes, it does matter)

2) A large bag of ear plugs to keep in your flight bag and use when on ramp.  APUs from corporate jet aircraft sitting between the flight line and the FBO are ridiculously loud.

Why? Because when you stop seeing and stop hearing you stop flying.]]></description>
