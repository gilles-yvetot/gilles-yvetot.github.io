He seems shocked]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice video, I havent been asked this in a long time . I dont think I have the type of teacher that really even cares. Since Im on the subject what if any advice do you have. He never really have a plan for me its like he&#039;s making things up as he goes. In turn wasting my time and money. I often aswhats the lesson for today and he says stuff like &quot;mmmm good question&quot; that makes me feel uneasy. What do I do]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, What a great learning video regarding the emergency landing! I am planning to actually begin lessons after I obtain my graduate degree next summer, so at this time I&#039;m reading (and, watching videos like this one) as much as I can to hopefully reduce my anxiety towards possible crisis situations (also, stalls etc).  I think the author is a great teacher, can you be my instructor?  Well, take care and have a safe summer! Tony]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Bob,

Great comment, infact that&#039;s inspiration for the next video or post! What a great idea! All situations are circumstantial. Few things I think about:

I&#039;d rather a high density of trees than a sparse forest. Trees can be an option but it&#039;s a scary one. Depending on the type of plane you&#039;re in water is also an option assuming you can land near the shore for quick escape.

Roads are a tough call. I really believe if I&#039;m going down I don&#039;t want to jeopardize anyone else&#039;s life along with mine. However at night.... A road maybe the only option.

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not a pilot but wonder about this:  what if there is nothing but trees from horizon to horizon?  Could a really good pilot glide right above tree level, then point the nose up at the last minute to try to get it to stall and then drop tail-first into the trees?  How about a densely populated area?  Would you take your chances on putting it down on a residential road?  The video is very good but I wonder about these (way) less than ideal situations...how do you handle these?]]></description>

Hi Vincent! You&#039;re right on target! If you&#039;re on an ATC frequency just make a call on that. However if you&#039;re not, 121.5 is always in your back pocket!

However, one remark. Instead of making a call on 121.5 I prefer to use the frequency I&#039;m currently on. The guy at the other end is already knowing about me, what I do and where I am. I reserve 121.5 for emergencies when I&#039;m not in contact with any ATC unit.]]></description>
