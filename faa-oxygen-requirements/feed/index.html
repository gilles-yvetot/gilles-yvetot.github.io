		<description><![CDATA[There is less O2 at higher altitude? No... the reason you need supplemental oxygen at high altitude is that the atmosphere pressure is lower than ground level. There are still plenty amount of oxygen at high altitude so we can still burn fuel right? However, the pressure differences between inside of our body(Lung to be exact) and outside of an airplane is so close, so we can&#039;t inhale much of oxygen or air compare to on the ground. That&#039;s why we need supplemental oxygen. When you fly at 43,000feet with B747 you don&#039;t need supplemental oxygen, the reason is that turbine engine compress an air and blow into the cabin and keep the air pressure high enough (normally set for 8,000feet), so we can inhale the air even though we fly at 43,000 feet. Is that clear?

		<description><![CDATA[Jason,

I think you made one mistake.  According to my recent version of the FAR&#039;s, specifically 91.211: (a) General.  No person may operate a civil aircraft of U.S. registry -- (1) At cabin pressure altitudes above 12,500 feet (MSL) up to and including 14,000 feet (MSL) ... (2) At cabin pressure altitudes above 14,000 feet (MSL) ...

		<description><![CDATA[Eric you are correct! 5,000 feet at night! Why is that?.... Because our eyes strain more at night to see thus requiring more oxygen!

Glad to hear you passed your checkride with my book! That rocks!

		<description><![CDATA[I believe the FAA recommends oxygen at 5000ft at night.  I think I learned that from you Jason?  I used your audio books and passed my checkride yesterday!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Jack!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well Yes and No&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Less Oxygen at night? Not the case. Your eyes work harder in low light conditions thus requiring more oxygen. The FAA &quot;recommends above 10,000 at night however it&#039;s simply a recommendation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A very good one at that&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jason]]></description>
