		<description><![CDATA[Just a reminder for those of you who are studying for your JAA exams. This method will always give you the wrong answer because JAA ATPL/CPL exams ask for &quot;track made good&quot; instead of true heading. The difference in technique is in these examples, (anything FAA, or when asked to find True Heading) you mark wind velocity UP from the grommet (center point), whereas doing things the JAA way, you have to mark wind velocity DOWN from the grommet. This essentially sets up a wind triangle for you on the E6B, and shows you the number of degrees to add or subtract (left or right) to get your &quot;track made good&quot;. This is the direction your airplane will track over the ground WITHOUT changing your course, basically NO WIND CORRECTION. You in the JAA examples are calculating where the wind will push you. The FAA exams ask for True Heading, so changing from a course to a heading, you add or subtract your wind correction angle. The &quot;track made good&quot; for the above question using 80KTAS is 004 True.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am a Canadian Pilot Wannabe and I love these Videos. They are allowing me to sample the material I will be expected to know and I really appreciate it.

I understand the lesson and it leaves me with a question as a non pilot in training.

If there is no ASOS or ATIS within 15 miles of you, how do you determine windspeed and direction to gather the numbers needed for this whole proceedure to work while in the air?

With Jason&#039;s permission, I made a &quot;guest-contribution&quot; video of my own to dive a little deeper into this and give some more background on the context in which you&#039;d be doing this.  The focus is a little off in parts of it, but I hope it helps.  I wound up having to split it in two due to length, but I think it works out well.  Check it out and let me know what you think!

		<description><![CDATA[Grant,

Glad I could help out too in my own small way.  You can create your own examples too - just make up some wind speeds and directions, true courses, and true air speeds, then figure it out!  Make it practical too - plot a course from your airport to another one nearby, use your plotter to get the True Course, then check the local winds aloft on http://aviationweather.gov and use the True Air Speed from the plane you fly to run a few test examples!  Good luck and feel free to ping me on Twitter @t0r0nad0 (oh&#039;s are zero&#039;s) if you need any help!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ooops!!!  Sorry about that guys!  I actually made a video for Jason over the weekend (not related to these examples) and completely forgot about this!  Sorry to leave you hanging.  Here are the answers:

Ex. 1:
Start by turning your disc so that 180* is under the true index.  Slide the ruler until the grommet in the middle is on 100kts.  Count up 12 (keeping in mind your scale - some E6-B&#039;s are 1 kt per line, some are 2) and make a mark.  Turn the disc until 250* is under the true index.  Now slide the rule until your wind mark is on 105kts, our True Air Speed.  The grommet is right between 100 and 101kts, which is our ground speed.  If you count the degrees (again, paying attention to the scale) over to your wind mark from center, you will see that it is about 6* left of center.

Now, let&#039;s look at our formula:

TC -L/+R WCA = TH -E/+W VAR = MH -E/+W DEV = CH

Since the Wind Correction Angle is 6* Left, we&#039;ll subtract that and plug in our numbers:

250* - 6* = 244* -E/+W VAR = MH -E/+W DEV = CH

Since the Variation is 4* W, we&#039;ll add that in to get our Magnetic Heading.

250* - 6* = 244* + 4* = 248* -E/+W DEV = CH

So, our Magnetic Heading is 248* and our Ground Speed is 100 or 101kts.

Ex. 2:

Use the same procedure as above and you&#039;ll get a Wind Correction Angle of 1* Left and a Ground Speed of 101 or 102kts.  Using the formula you see:

130* - 1* = 129* + 9* = 138* -E/+W DEV = CH

Magnetic Heading: 138*
Ground Speed: 101 or 102 kts.

What did you guys get?]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ooops!!!  Sorry about that guys!  I actually made a video for Jason over the weekend (not related to these examples) and completely forgot about this!  Sorry to leave you hanging.  Here are the answers:</p>
<p>Ex. 1:<br />
Start by turning your disc so that 180* is under the true index.  Slide the ruler until the grommet in the middle is on 100kts.  Count up 12 (keeping in mind your scale &#8211; some E6-B&#8217;s are 1 kt per line, some are 2) and make a mark.  Turn the disc until 250* is under the true index.  Now slide the rule until your wind mark is on 105kts, our True Air Speed.  The grommet is right between 100 and 101kts, which is our ground speed.  If you count the degrees (again, paying attention to the scale) over to your wind mark from center, you will see that it is about 6* left of center.</p>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s look at our formula:</p>
<p>TC -L/+R WCA = TH -E/+W VAR = MH -E/+W DEV = CH</p>
<p>Since the Wind Correction Angle is 6* Left, we&#8217;ll subtract that and plug in our numbers:</p>
<p>250* &#8211; 6* = 244* -E/+W VAR = MH -E/+W DEV = CH</p>
<p>Since the Variation is 4* W, we&#8217;ll add that in to get our Magnetic Heading.</p>
<p>250* &#8211; 6* = 244* + 4* = 248* -E/+W DEV = CH</p>
<p>So, our Magnetic Heading is 248* and our Ground Speed is 100 or 101kts.</p>
<p>Ex. 2:</p>
<p>Use the same procedure as above and you&#8217;ll get a Wind Correction Angle of 1* Left and a Ground Speed of 101 or 102kts.  Using the formula you see:</p>
<p>130* &#8211; 1* = 129* + 9* = 138* -E/+W DEV = CH</p>
<p>Magnetic Heading: 138*<br />
Ground Speed: 101 or 102 kts.</p>
<p>What did you guys get?</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Matt,

That&#039;s correct you can use your electronic E6B on the written test and the checkride. However be ready to use the old fashioned one just incase :)
