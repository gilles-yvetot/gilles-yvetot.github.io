		<description><![CDATA[So what do you do with the DA once you know that number?  The aircraft feels like it&#039;s at the DA, does that mean you subtract that number from the ground roll distance for your type aircraft or do you add that to the required ground role and landing numbers?  I just want to be clear now that we have the DA what&#039;s next?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s sometimes much easier to use 125 ft per deg.C which equates to 1000
 ft per 8 deg.C. E.g., if difference between Std.T. and OAT is 12 deg.C,
 the extra (density) altitude is 1500 ft.



Note that the difference between the two formulas is miniscule relative 
to the error due to not taking humidity into account (humidity DOES 
affect the calculation to a large degree, much more than extra 5 ft per 1
 deg.C).



Another note/correction: the Std.T should not be taken to be 15 deg.C 
regardless of altitude, but instead whatever it is in the &quot;std. 
atmosphere&quot; at the pre-calculated pressure altitude. E.g. if solving for
 conditions at an airport with field elevation of 5000 ft (with, e.g., 
pressure altitude being 6000 ft, and OAT being 3 deg.C), the Std.T for 
6000 ft is the same 3 deg.C as the OAT, and so the formula would give 
density altitude of 6000 ft (same as the PA), NOT 6000 + 125 * 12 = 7500
 ft.

		<description><![CDATA[Hello Peter:

I stand corrected - I should not have used the word &#039;never&#039;.
&#039;Density Altitude&#039; is best thought of in the context of &#039;negative performance&#039;..
WE LIKE positive performance - so improvements are not a concern !!!!
However, to be absolutely correct, you are indeed right.  My concern is that student pilots just might think of Density Altitude as a good thing at a bad time.  So, my apologies to all.

		<description><![CDATA[nice video, just to point out to new students to keep in mind that most aviation temperatures are in C (Celsius) not F (Fahrenheit). It would be good if you explained that you used 15C because you are at sea level. Here in Tucson we are at 2500&#039; to start, our ISA temp would be 20C, or did I confused that? Thanks]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ Jason.. Another great vid.. Thank you for posting.. Im just curious on 
how you derived the formula.. Also, the (  OAT - ISA ) , will the ISA 
temperature in the equation be the value at sea level ( 15 C) no matter 
what pressure altittude we are calculating  or will it be the ISA 
temperature at that altitude.. Cheers.. Niv]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[After looking at your formula, if you had to do the calculation quickly in your head you could just say that for every degree C over 15C, just add 120.  If it were 22C for example, just add 7 x 12o, or 840 to your pressure altitude.  Same thing as you&#039;re doing, just said a different way.  

By the way, does that work on the &quot;backside&quot; of the temperature curve too?  In other words, if it were 10C, would you SUBTRACT 5 x 120, or 60ft from your elevation?

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Marc:

You ask a great question.  A non-turbocharged aircraft can only suck in as many oxygen molecules as the atmosphere can deliver - as we increase altitude, and that includes changes in density altitude - those molecules get fewer &#038; fewer, therefore less &#038; less power available.  A turbocharged aircraft will use an &#039;air compressor&#039; (the turbo) to pack air into the cylinders - typically to sea level pressure - so the aircraft retains performance with changes in altitude and density altitude.  When the aircraft boost level is set up to sea level pressure we usually refer to that as being &#039;turbo-normalized&#039;.  
Hope this helps.

		<description><![CDATA[Great video! As you know I&#039;m new to flying. I&#039;m trying to take it all in by reading tons of stuff but have been frustrated with a simple explanation of density altitude and how effects flight.  You  turned my feeble light on with the statement &quot;it&#039;s the altitude at where the plane feels like it&#039;s at&quot;! 

Thanks!
