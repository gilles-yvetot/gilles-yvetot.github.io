		<description><![CDATA[I truly believe in the comment about airspeed management! I&#039;m a low time bush pilot. About 1400 hours, but pretty much all the flying I do is high altitude strips in the Alberta, BC and some Alaska mountains. I do fly a very forgiving cessna 206 for an oil company. You can screw up pretty bad, and still make about anything (not quite like a cub, but not that terribly far off either...as far as mountain flying goes!).

At any rate, if you can master the airspeeds, you should never have any problem with short, high strips. Sometimes...you fly overhead, and you think...hmmmmm, this is going to be tough. Stick to the airspeed indicator, and you&#039;ll make it every damn time!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[haha steve I&#039;m still very protective of it! 512R is my baby!

However with teaching comes a few bumps and bruises :)

I never even turn the carb heat on doing soft field landings.

Now on a cold day I will real quick just to clear it but it goes right back to the off position.

		<description><![CDATA[Chris,

You&#039;re exactly right it is a huge booster of confidence for student pilots especially for the off airport landings.

Glad you enjoyed the video.

Work your hardest to get out there and try a real soft field landing

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d love to use some grass strips...but like someone else has mentioned it has always been either against school policies and/or insurance mandated no grass strips.  I think landing on grass strips is also a confidence builder for emergency, off site landings.  It builds confidence that yes, I can put this thing on the ground without having pavement under me.  Good video Jason!  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Michael!

Ya the place is sweet! 6,000 seems like over kill but it&#039;s a blast!

I had a similar problem my school didn&#039;t permit soft field landings either! When I opened up my flight school in town I made sure to make it a requirement of my students. Plus it saves on tire wear :)

		<description><![CDATA[So do you never use carb heat at all and keep the power up? Or do you just close it on short final?

Concerning how I was taught, there&#039;s always the chance that things a little differently since it&#039;s a rental. I&#039;ve certainly seen people do things differently when it&#039;s their own airplane that has to be maintained.

Of course, you hand yours over to new students so you can&#039;t be all THAT protective of it... ;-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[6000 feet, holy cow.  That&#039;s bigger than any runway I have yet landed on.  And it&#039;s grass?!  Sounds like they were trying to make it long enough for jets.  Actually I was thinking, they probably made it that long so people could land long and roll out right to their back yard hah.

Yep, I&#039;m guilty of never landing on grass yet.  It was against school rules while I was learning, even with an instructor.  After getting my licence my instructor said I should go back out with him sometime after it gave up raining constantly and go get the experience.

Haven&#039;t done it yet &#062;.&#060;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jason,

Gr8 video, could have better, if someone was capturing video while you landed on grass strip. My bad, in my school I and all other students practiced (simulated) soft field landings on our home base runway. I did found a grass strip near by; but instructor didn&#039;t allowed to land, and we took off again when it was just 100ft; guess he even didn&#039;t do it at first place.. Wish to do soft field maneuver landing on real grass strip in future in my own plane or with a instructor like you..]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Steve,

hmm that is interesting. Different perspectives I guess. I&#039;ve pulled junk out of my carburetor even when I take these precautions.

Ya 6,000 ft is sweet. A King Air is actually based there! Now that&#039;s a sight to see!

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting - I fly out of a grass strip and we were always taught to use carb heat. Not that I disagree that it can allow bad things in through the unfiltered air - we were also taught to close it as soon as your rollout is complete. All my post-solo training was in a 150, for the record. Anyway, it&#039;s always neat to see how different CFIs teach things.

Oh, and 6000 feet of grass is insane - I thought our 3200 feet were long!]]></description>
