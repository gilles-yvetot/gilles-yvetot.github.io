		<description><![CDATA[Yes!  

The knot Jason shows (two simple nooses) will slip up to the wing under heavy load adding slack to the line and eventually becoming impossible to untie.  The best knot on the Wiki page you reference is ABOK #1855, the Midshipmen&#039;s Hitch, though it too will eventually slip under severe load, especially with newer style ropes.

The locking two half hitch approach in the AOPA article referenced by another poster below is basically the first part of the midshipman&#039;s hitch (aka an Awning Hitch, ABOK #1798) done twice.  That makes it easier to untie, but more susceptible to slipping under a bouncing load.

The king of knots if a serious blow is coming is a Bowline with the tail tied off with a Double overhand knot http://www.animatedknots.com/bowline/index.php?Categ=typeendloops&#038;LogoImage=LogoGrog.jpg&#038;Website=www.animatedknots.com.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have also used, please excuse the term, an upside down hangman&#039;s noose. Another I have used is to make a slip knot at the top of the rope, fed it through the metal anchor and pull the rope through the loop at the top. It holds very well and gives enough slack if a hurricane moves through. Really the best is your method of tying down an aircraft with rope. Do not forget to take the gust lock with you on a trip. If you do knot(pun intended) you can take the seat belts and wrap them around the yoke. Not part of the tying down procedure but keeps the hinged things from flying away without an airplane attached.
