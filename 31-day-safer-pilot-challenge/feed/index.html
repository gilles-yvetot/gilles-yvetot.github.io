		<description><![CDATA[Here in Australia some places have large temperature changes. Alice Springs can be below freezing at night and 55 degrees C in the shade at the hottest part of the day. So imagine what that does to the air inside fuel tanks with dewpoint and moiture contents changing so much it is very usual to find water in the fuel even when the air is dry and it hasnt rained for weeks. From a student pilot in Australia. Love your clips and the safer pilot challenge. fantastic idea ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great video! I&#039;m looking forward to more!

I experienced an engine failure on rollout last year. I hadn&#039;t left the ground yet, but I was glad I was used to running through in my mind before takeoff what I would do in the case of an engine failure.]]></description>
