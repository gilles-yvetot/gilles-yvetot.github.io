		<description><![CDATA[ahaaaa as a student i would have always liked if the school logged time Â &quot; when the wheels leave the ground &quot;Â but over that now...i would really love if the company lets me log using the last opposition Â &quot; when you get in your car and start driving to the airport..&quot; (company pays me to the hour... ;-) )anywaysÂ reading some of the comments belowi do agree to &quot;TEMP3 &quot; about the hobbs time rule being Â annoying to charter operators (to all actually, even students ) but i think Â where as Â a rules regarding how many hours the pilot can fly without a break, i think waiting at the tarmac is even more frustrating and probably add up to more fatigue Â than actual flying !!! so i feel &quot;YES &quot; even taxi or holding time on the ground should be counted to add up the total permitted flying time...and ya Â engine stopping at 10,000 feet and hobbs not ticking, i think faa will allow us to double the total log time. Also if it happens again more often, then they will probably ask you and your engineer buddy to log even more time in their office... (more important things to worry that time the your log book entry(s).... Â Â anyways hobbs are for me backed up with a simple time note scribe on the Â flight planer Â usually both average up to be same on a long run....Â anyways as always thanks Jason....Â ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Speaking of being charged rental time by HOBBS time or tach time.
I knew one rental pilot who used to climb really high with the rental aircraft and glide down with the engine off. Restart, climb again, etc.
Claims he made the same trip with significantly less billable rental time.

		<description><![CDATA[You forgot to mention when you STOP logging the time (though you implied it):
You stop logging time when on that same &quot;intent to fly&quot; session you finally shut down the engine no longer intending to fly.
Â In practical terms this means start when you start up the engine, stop when you&#039;ve taxiied to hanger or tie-down and shut down engine.

These rules are sometimes annoying to charter operators (where there are rules regarding how many hours the pilot can fly withoutÂ a break, etc) because if they taxi out and Â they&#039;re on the tarmac held up for an hour waiting to takeoff at a busy airport that eats up an hour of their permitted flying time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Acft moving under own pwr-Okay- Real scenario at my airport- Â Distance to run up area from parking is approx 4k feet. Â You leave park with intent to fly but long taxi/runup time can add considerable time before actual t/o- Is this proper to be logged-I don&#039;t think so

		<description><![CDATA[Great video. Should have elaborated a little more about logging XC time, hood time etc.Â  Say you take off and land at a airport 50 + miles and 1.2 hours later. Then you proceed to spend .5 hours doing touch and goes - what do you count as PIC-XC time? All of it or the first 1.2 only?]]></description>

Thats a really interesting question. I&#039;m going to have to ask someone smarter than myself (myÂ mechanic) and get back with you.

		<description><![CDATA[Kenn,

If you have the intent to fly that is loggable time. However the .1 or .2 that it takes to realize you&#039;re not flying isn&#039;t that significant in the grand scheme of things... Now will you as a renter have to pay for that... 90% of the time yes unfortunately. Depends on what kind of mood the flight school manager is in :)Â

		<description><![CDATA[HiÂ  JasonÂ  great service youÂ  provide keep on the good work.

In SwedenÂ  (Europe) we log in our logbook five minuted before take-off and five minutes after take-of (in UTC) . 

In the airplane-logbook we log actual take-of and landing time (local time)to the closest 5 minutes intervall.Â

		<description><![CDATA[Since you mentioned Tach time, do you know how it works on a constant rpm aircraft?Â  If it&#039;s also just using the RPM as a multiplier to the actual time, can I theoretically get the same power settings with a higher MP / lower RPM combo (to the limit stated on POH) so that the flight will be easier on my wallet? ;-)

		<description><![CDATA[Do you log your flight in hours (e.g.: 1.0, 1.3, etc...) or in hours:minutes (e.g.: 1:00, 1:18, or even like 1:23 if you actually measure the aircraft movement with your stopwatch)?]]></description>
