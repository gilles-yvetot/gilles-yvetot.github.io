		<description><![CDATA[Great job Steve. This is something I teach my students, use the VASI and PAPI to confirm the usual 3 degree glide slope. A little known fact is the VASI&#039;s and PAPI&#039;s (not MAMI&#039;s) are usually set up for multi-engine aircraft where the pilot sits higher. In a single engine aircraft, I follow white over white or pink over white all the way down with the proper approach speed for the conditions. The VASI will take you to the 1000 foot marker, which should have you touch down in the first third of the runway. Hold that VASI all the way and do not let it go all red. Bottom line: steeper approach wins out of low approach every time.]]></description>

Could you share who you&#039;re talking to when you&#039;re using flight following?  And also, what frequencies are used and how to find them?


Thanks-

		<description><![CDATA[Yesterday I was flying back to my home airport from a day trip in a Piper Archer. Airport was reporting winds 240@8 and I was given the choice between 19 and 32. I opted for 32 as 8 knots is well withing my limits as well as the planes. Anyway I touched down lightly on the left main and continued down the runway, used aerodynamic breaking until the turn off where I applied slight braking pressure. Plane started to turn then is started to veer hard left. Into the the dirt I went. My initial reaction was that the front tire must have spun or something so I told tower I needed to get out and see what is going on. Shutdown, And it was a deflated left main. They sent a maintenance truck out there, put a new wheel on and i taxied to the shop. I got there and looked at the tire and there wasn&#039;t any damage to the tire at all. So much so, they are going to reuse it. They said the tube had ripped. They kept asking me if I landed hard and my answer was no. It was a typical light crosswind landing. Yes I had to letdown that tire first but it wasn&#039;t hard at all. They also asked if I checked tire pressure and I said I did a visual check before start- and they didn&#039;t look low. 
So I guess my question is, is this just bad luck, or is there something I am missing that I may done wrong to have caused this?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s also best to explain the reason for the lower ceiling of class E at 700&#039; as its for the instrument approaches that are typically there so the VFR guys will be kept out of the pattern when ceilings are low to provide separation with IFR traffic shooting the approach. It&#039;d be bad to pop out of the clouds and have conflicting traffic.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice video Jason!  I pretty much do exactly as you do in the video with one exception:  I leave the carb heat on when I throttle back to idle.  This is  because that is what the configuration will be when I am below 2000 RPM in the pattern and especially when I cut the throttle on flare.  Up here in Maine carb heat is our best friend (particularly from autumn to spring).  I would like to know whether the engine is going to cut out on me when I have pulled the throttle to idle during landing, especially if for some reason I need to apply power and/or do a go around.  I figure it is better to have the engine die while solidly on the ground rather than during the landing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Excellent!! I see guys all the time going into class e airspace, popping out of the clouds, seeing the runway and then cancelling their IFR clearances and they aren&#039;t 500 feet below the clouds. (I am aware of 2 FAA officials sitting at KPLN (Pellston, MI) as a couple of jet jockeys (read that as ATP&#039;s) did this. I don&#039;t know what the outcome was, but I hope it was only remedial training, but I doubt it. And these are professional pilots that make their living flying. Remember the FAA&#039;s new slogan, &quot;We aren&#039;t happy until you aren&#039;t happy!&quot; And thanks for the great videos.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For sure!! I like that idea!


However It does remind me of that story when a student pilot right before takeoff switched takes and had the engine fail on takeoff.

I like your idea of taxi on one.... then switch...runup and leave it on that tank. As you know it works
