		<description><![CDATA[Incredible points Peter! Bummer we didn&#039;t get a chance to connect at Osh! There is always next year.


This is why I love when you guys leave comments... I learn so much :)


Being that I don&#039;t fly composite aircraft I never really thought of how or where to ground/bond the aircraft. Neat point!


However my favorite points you made were the last 2! How many times have you seen people fuel up, get in, and go? THEY DIDNT EVEN SUMP IT! So they&#039;re just trusting that airports fuel? Geeez


I was flying a 182 with a student the other day and we noticed we were burning significantly more in the left wing vs the right wing... Now isn&#039;t that a point for concern and something to address? Absolutely. But if you just hop in and go or care less about how much goes in each wing you&#039;ll never know!


Great points my friend

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jason:

Good topic. I saw you at the SAFE dinner at Oshkosh; sorry I didn&#039;t get a chance to introduce myself.

A few things to add:

* Composite aircraft often have specific grounding/bonding points documented in the POH.  Don&#039;t assume the tiedowns are sufficient, though with metal aircraft they are likely to be.

* Check that the nozzle is closed before powering on the pump.  Sometimes the nozzle valve has a weak spring, or the nozzle has been hung on its handle.  If you power up the fuel pump with the nozzle open, you will pay for a lot of fuel on the ground.

* Make sure you park so your wings are level.  Some fueling areas are not level.

* Some aircraft with wet wings take a while for fuel to settle because there are relatively small holes through the wing ribs..  If you fuel quickly to a certain level and then walk away, you might find later that you don&#039;t have all the fuel you think you have.  On such an aircraft, one effective technique when adding a lot of fuel is to fuel one wing, then the other, then go back and top off the first wing, then top off the second wing.

* If you want a full tank, you must really fill it all the way to the top.  A 1/2&quot; gap can add up to several gallons because the wings are so wide and flat.

* It is impolite to leave the hose coiled poorly.  That can cause it to jam for the next pilot. If you are wearing shoes, and the hose has an electric rewind, you can use your foot to guide the hose to a nice even coil.

* Hold on to the grounding strap while you gently rewind it.  Don&#039;t let it rewind freely and snap in.  Two things can happen if you do this: (1) the wire can get tangled and jam, and (2) the clip on the end of the wire can break off.  Either would render the fuel tank out-of-service for the next pilot.

* Check the actual amount of fuel purchased against what you thought you were going to buy.  If you are consistently putting in more fuel than you anticipate, you need to figure out why.  Reconsider your fuel planning procedures.  The only acceptable error is to land with more fuel than you think you have.

* If you can delay sumping the tanks after fueling (for example, by having lunch), you will get better results from the sump.  It can take a while for water and/or sediment to settle to the bottom of the tank after fueling.
Keep it up, Jason.  Good stuff.

		<description><![CDATA[Nice try Jason but I think you missed a lot, much of which has been picked up in the replies.  I would add:-  Don&#039;t wear flip flops, you are going up and down a ladder with a heavy fuel hose!  Do chock the airplane, if it can move one day it will.  (Murphy&#039;s Law)  Don&#039;t ding the wing leading edge with the fuel nozzle, check your leading edge to see how many times this has already happened. If fuelling from a truck bond the truck to the airplane (or vice versa) or bond both to ground.
Amazing how something which looks so simple is actually very difficult to do well ie safely.

		<description><![CDATA[Technically you are bonding not grounding, unless a chain is on the ground. You could still cause a spark by touching the aircraft, likely rare however. Good points in you video!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A really good topic this one Jason, it did not occur to me that this might not be taught as a matter of course.
Again I count myself as very fortunate.
My instructor, Dave Welton, did cover refueling and a thousand other things that he&#039;d run into during his many years in aviation. 
Countless times since I have had his words of wisdom pop into my head!


And we always refer to &quot;grounding&quot; the aircraft, just as in the UK I&#039;m sure they &quot;earth&quot; it, terminology is of no consequence as long as the process is correct.
(BTW, the process I use is almost exactly the same as yours).]]></description>
