		<description><![CDATA[A great audio presentation. You couldn&#039;t have scripted this better

Incredible ! The Bernoulli effect is the same in a single engine fixed gear as a transonic fighter. I had the privilege of seeing a corporate owned  King Air cockpit back in the 70s. Compared to the Alon A2s it was like walking into a DC-3, a scary scenario for a newbe, but the needle/ball, airspeed indicator and artificial horizon were all there.  I&#039;m not sure I could have easily transitioned into it at 6 months with my license, but at 75 or 100 hours it was a definite maybe if they gave me some basic information like clean and dirty stall speeds and approach speeds. 

Incredibly, no one at Miami asked the pilot about his fuel situation and tank settings. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Impressive! The low time pilot performed like a well instructed pilot. Clear, concise, no nonsense communication and professional control of his emotions allowed him to contact the right people and access the resources he needed to make this a successful event. Giving credit to this guy for pulling off the landing and credit to those who fed him the information he needed to get those souls home.   ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I always think about situations like this when I board a commercial airliner. Not knowing if there is another pilot (if both became incappacitated on board), who could actually fly a commercial airliner. I would&#039;ve tackled the situation nervously, but I would do anything in my knowledge/experience to succeed the &quot;mission&quot; of landing an airliner. I&#039;m only a student pilot. ]]></description>

Good call on hunting for the POH... Knowing your speeds and expected performance is make or break. Thankfully ATC helped him in this regard

Always learning because you never know is right! Staying current is more than just doing flight reviews every 24 months :)

		<description><![CDATA[Steve,

You said what no one else was willing to say.... In a sick sort of way this is something &quot;some&quot; pilots dream of.

Regardless... It goes to show you how far staying proficient and cool under pressure can take you.

Wonder comment thanks for the addition!

		<description><![CDATA[I thought the guy did a great job on such short notice. I&#039;m very familiar with this transcript. I too am a low time pilot. For me, I would have probably gotten control of the airplane first. I f you can&#039;t control the AP, the only solution is to shut the AP down, get her straight and level and hand fly it. (Basic Pilot Skills) I then would have declared an emergency and and started hunting for the POH which should be within reach and started to get a general idea of my V-speeds. Sometimes they are printed or stamped  in plain view on the panel. 

I too am a low time pilot but when I board ANY aircraft, I&#039;m not just a passenger; I&#039;m a pilot. And I don&#039;t mean a bold pilot. This may seem silly to some pilots but before I board any aircraft even if it&#039;s a commercial airliner, I do a little research on that aircraft and I even print out a copy of the v speeds for that bird and stick them in my pocket. Yes, many  aircraft today have some very complex systems but I am not easily intimidated by them. It&#039;s an aircraft. I can get around the systems especially with some help on the phone or radio. What I want to know is how much we weigh, what are the the  limitations of that aircraft and how much fuel is on board. Hopefully I won&#039;t ever get this opportunity and the cost of another persons life but I am always asking myself the question that we all should be asking ourselves; WHAT IF??]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Completely awesome story. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time, visualizing what he was doing. You know, at one time or another we have all thought about having to do this very thing- maybe as an exercise in precaution or maybe a morbid fantasy. The stewardess gets on the speaker- &quot;Are any pilots on board?!&quot; He did extremely well in communicating what the limits of his capability were, and what he needed. ATC had difficulty getting him facts quickly, but considering the time frame, did great. What was also amazing was how the controller cleared the frequency and handed everyone off so quickly- and the response of the other pilots was like clockwork and they took their frequencies and got off fast- and he blew through at least one a second or so it seemed. The passenger/pilot&#039;s focus on the raw functioning of the airplane was exactly right, and he did not let the controller get him distracted with things that may have confused him- like the checklist. This was not a time to see how much he could handle, or how smart he might be. One thing to be sure of- he was not a professional, but he was a pilot. He knew what the priorities were. He knew how to hold an altitude, heading and speed. He knew how to land. One thing I learned in my early years ago hanging around corporate pilots- what separates the professionals from the private fliers, is not the ability to fly, but to do it precisely, and to be ready for any circumstance, and have a plan to get out of it. This man was a pilot, that is for sure. Thank God he was on board, qualified or not. We all collectively breathe a sigh of relief upon his landing.]]></description>

This was not a time to see how much he could handle, or how smart he might be. One thing to be sure of- he was not a professional, but he was a pilot. He knew what the priorities were. He knew how to hold an altitude, heading and speed. He knew how to land. One thing I learned in my early years ago hanging around corporate pilots- what separates the professionals from the private fliers, is not the ability to fly, but to do it precisely, and to be ready for any circumstance, and have a plan to get out of it. This man was a pilot, that is for sure. Thank God he was on board, qualified or not. We all collectively breathe a sigh of relief upon his landing.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Hats off 
and 
All Respect!!! 
To both ATC and the PILOT flying the B200 back to a beautiful landing .

Thanks for this clip Jason!!
The guy meant to be passenger, surely nervous down to core but kept his COOL right up to the end to successfully cooperated with the ATC‘s instruction to safety.
 Not only saving himself but probably preventing a more horrific end !!

I don’t know about you all!! But lesson for me to learn from this 
keep cool and patience 

I believe the main reason he managed to get the plane down is coz he realized the problem 
and kept himself cool and all open to instruction from ATC  all with “just the right” amount of self  confidence !!!
 And leaving rest to the Good Lord to lend a hand or two 
(   “me and the good lord are hand flying this niner delta whiskey..”  )

God forbids but if time comes I hope to pull off the same!!! 

Thanks

		<description><![CDATA[This is just an amazing story.  What you don&#039;t hear on this version is the last words spoken by the pilot.  He makes his check-in, and you can just hear something&#039;s off with him.

&quot;Me and the Good Lord are hand-flying&quot;  Priceless!

Doug White remains so remarkably calm and professional given the circumstances, but then, just after touchdown, you can hear that he can&#039;t hold back the emotion much longer.

Thanks for sharing, Jason.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I remember when this happen. That had to be over whelming for him and I don’t know if they ever revealed who the other passengers was but if it was his family I’m sure that just added to the pressure. I am in no way qualified to pilot such an aircraft but have sat right seat in some much high performance aircraft then the CE172 I am accustom to and I can say it can be intimidating when you are closing in at 120 instead of 60. If you re-listen to his voice after touchdown you can tell he was chocked up. Absolutely a wonderful job. The praise can only go to God. The outcome may have been much different if he had not had any previous flight experience.  

Thanks Jason for sharing that video.

		<description><![CDATA[As a Private Pilot myself rated in Single Engine, I frequently get to fly for fun with friends who are rated in Multi Engine, Single Pilot King Airs and Raytheon Premier. I have made it a habit, whenever flying in an aircraft unfamiliar to me to get to know the basic controls of the aircraft by asking the PIC before take off in case of emergency. At least, if ever I encounter such situation, I can get by and if needed, I can assist the PIC. It is part of being a good pilot....as Jason always mentions, a good pilot is always learning!!!]]></description>
