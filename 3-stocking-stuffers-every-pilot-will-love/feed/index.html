		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure if my previous questions made it to the comments, so I&#039;m trying again.

---

I&#039;m reading http://faraimbook.com/ and I&#039;ve got a question on yourexplanation of FAR 61.35You say that to take the knowledge test you need an endorsementfrom a certified FLIGHT instructor. ( emphasis mine).   Q: I read that a certified ground instructor is authorized to endorse as well, right?Another question on your FAR 61.109 - I&#039;m confused when you say (under the 3 hours of night flying ), that &quot;10 HOURS of takeoffs andlandings to a full stop&quot;. I read 61.109 a) (2) (ii) to be 10 takeoffsand landings to a full stop ( not 10 HOURS ).Is that just a typo?for FAR 91.203 you list &quot;ARROW&quot; but the Radio Certificate, Operator&#039;sManual, and Weight and balance aren&#039;t mentioned in 91.203 - maybesomeplace else?
   ( or maybe the Radio Certificate is an FCC requirement )

		<description><![CDATA[No problem man! For whatever reason Amazon won&#039;t take Paypal (might have something to do that Ebay owns Paypal) You can but the ebook through Paypal. Or if you email me (jason@m0a:disqus .com) I can send you a paypal invoice and just ship you a extra copy I have here at the house of the paperback.

Let me know

		<description><![CDATA[Wow I wish I had the FAR/AIM in Plain English last year when I was working on my private. That seems like such a useful tool. Do you happen to have plans to do such a thing for instrument pilots by any chance? It would probably be a lot longer but might be still more helpful than having it search through the 2,000+ regulations.]]></description>
