		<description><![CDATA[Jason, Could you go a little more in depth on why a mode C transponder is required above and in class C but not below. If they dont know your altitude how can they determine if you&#039;re above or below it? Thanks love the vids.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank You Jason for your awesome posts. They are short, but they are very informative. I don&#039;t know how or why you do them, but I am very glad you do. I was out of the aviation world for a few years and getting back in has been a bit hard but I&#039;m glad I found your site. Keep up the good work, it is very appreciated and I wanted you to know that. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jason, 
I have answered the questions before you gave the answer &#038; I did better this time. 6/10 to 9/10... 
Great video...
Another way to remember the sqwauk codes, I use the &quot;ICE&quot;
I - Interference - 7500
C - Communication - 7600
E - Emergency - 7700
I litterally take me 5 seconds to get to the code I have to use and hey, you wanna forget the ICE when you are sitting on a hot patato ;-)]]></description>
