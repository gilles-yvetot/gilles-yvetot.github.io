		<description><![CDATA[I have viewed your flight fallowing video.  However my question is requesting flight fallowing from an approach controller.  I fly from KHGR to KLNS.  Approach for KLNS is Harrisburg Approach.  However I am not going to Harrisburg.  So what is the basic difference in requesting fallowing from an approach such as Harrisburg approach and requesting it from Washington Center that I would use for approach control for KHGR? ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jason,
I recently found you&#039;re web site and very much enjoy listening.
I am in Carson City NV. and thinking of going back to complete my pilot training.
I trained with a great CFI in a 152 and did my solo after 18 hours, in 1983.
Because of health issues, time and life itself getting in the way, l had to stop.
Now that l am a bit older and have a friend and neighbor who is a pilot from about the same time, l think l will complete my training to become a light sport pilot.
It&#039;s great to listen to talk about flying and you&#039;re enthusiasm is obvious as well as contagious.
Thank You.

		<description><![CDATA[When requesting VFR flight following I find that the following works well in the busy New York area. 

&quot;New York Approach Sky Lane  N5456T .. VFR request&quot;. 

That way the controller isn&#039;t looking for my aircraft information wondering who I am. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ed,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That&#039;s awesome! It&#039;s really a technique I find enough CFI&#039;s are not showing their students. But it really is like night and day for my students and helps their landings almost instantly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jason]]></description>
