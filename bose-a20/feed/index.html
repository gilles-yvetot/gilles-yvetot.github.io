		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m in the market for a headset. I&#039;d like to get a noise-cancelling one since I am a musician and would like to preserve my hearing as much as possible. &lt;br&gt;But those tend to be higher-end model headsets, with features like a jack for cell phones or MP3 players that  Matt was talking about in the video that I&#039;m wary of - is it really a good idea to have those added distractions when you&#039;re flying? It sounds like &quot;messing with an iPod&quot; would be one of those things in a chain of events that lead to an accident.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don&#039;t know about funny stories, maybe have to get back on that.]]></description>
