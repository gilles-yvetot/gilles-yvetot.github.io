		<description><![CDATA[Im not really with you on the partial flaps on landing.  My point of view is using full flaps on x-wind landings and, if strong, retracting them after touch down while holding the control into the wind.  The full flaps will allow you to plant the airplane on the runway sooner and you will be less prone to be tossed around in a gust of wind while close to the runway at a slow airspeed and reduced control effectiveness.  That is my 2 cent.  Dont get me wrong im not saying  that you are incorrect, just another view.  Happy flying!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great video, slick landing. Hope mine get that good some day. My CFI &#038; I were up Tuesday practicing these in the C152, RY 22, winds 180 16G27. None of mine were that pretty, but they were survivable. Put me down for a vote on setting up aligned as soon as you turn final, carry the cross controls all the way down. One thing I&#039;ve learned but still have trouble with, close to the ground (50 ft. or less) the wind usually lessens and I find myself slipping toward the lowered wing, have to take out some inputs just before landing and then start putting aileron back in during the rollout. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jason, I would add that as important as it is to land on centerline with aileron correction, it is JUST AS IMPORTANT to continue to keep enough aileron into the wind after landing as needed.  Otherwise, a perfect crosswind touchdown turns into a bad situation when your plane&#039;s wheels start making a screeching noise as you finish slowing down.  Also, having done a lot of crosswind landings during my training, I seem to be able to get myself back into a comfort zone if every now and then I just do a &quot;low approach&quot; and fly in ground effect the length of the runway to sort of align my yoke and rudder skills after not doing crosswinds for awhile.  Good video and keep &#039;em coming.

		<description><![CDATA[Potayto, potahtoe, crab or not to crab, or a hybrid for crosswind landings. My vote is to figure out as early as possible the right amount of aileron for drift and the right amount of rudder to keep the plane down the centerline. For me that is as you get established on final. I call it crosswind muscle memory. I feel low hour students and low hour private pilots should not have to do a lot of movement of aileron and rudder when getting close to the transition. There is too much happening too close to the ground for me. That way &quot;the cherry on top of the sundae &quot; never moves, which means the passengers never realize there even is a crosswind and the pilot is cross controlling down final. I proved this twice at two different times with two different students. At 1000 using rwy 06 winds 320 @ 18 G20 in a C152, at 1200 with a different student same runway 310 @ 20 G24. Same technique, same C152, same upwind wheel landing, with no flaps and little faster airspeed 70 knots, same results. Piece of cake sorry piece of Key Lime Pie.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jason,

    When it came to crosswind landings, I was still finding myself apprehensive. I went up today and during a cross country i flew every maneuver I could think of 3 times each. Stalls, 45 degree turns, S turns, turns around a point, Slow flight, emergency landings. While flying the maneuvers I found myself listening to ATIS for Trinidad. The crosswinds were 7 knots. I figured that if you don&#039;t practice them there is no way to gain the confidence for crosswind takeoff&#039;s and landings. So I began doing touch and go&#039;s. I did a total of 10 and did a full stop. By the time I had done my full stop the wind was a direct 90 degree crosswind at 14 knots. I was still able to hold the centerline. I then flew back to Pueblo and did my softest landing yet. I had to look out the window to see that my wheels were on the ground. I even got a few compliments from a few Air Force guys who were watching. They could not believe i only have 74 hours and 6 since getting my PPL. Your advice on this video was great. I am not as apprehensive about crosswinds now, because I know that as long as they are within aircraft limits I can handle them safely. Thanks Again]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[How much extra airspeed do you carry on final to keep the control authority?  I am having trouble with finding the harmony of the aileron and rudder control inputs.  Thanks for all of your videos, as a new pilot it&#039;s great to be able to visualize the maneuvers before you get in the hot seat!

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jason, What are your thoughts on setting up for landing right after you turn to final instead of at the roundout and holding it all the way down? That way, if your in a pretty stiff x-wind you will know early on if you can hold the airplane where you want it and if not, you can go around instead of finding it out at 5 feet above the runway........just a thought.

		<description><![CDATA[This is what I struggle with.  My instructor insists that the stall horn is sounding before my wheels can touch down.  My question is, as you raise the nose as you approach stall speed there is a longer time in ground affect that in your video.  Thus, it is harder to keep this correction in without drifting.  How can I accomplish this more easily?

		<description><![CDATA[I enjoyed your feature on X wind landings. In the Late summer of &#039;67 I was sent back to New Jersey  where I would finish out my summer employment and ultimately return to school in Connecticut. I had not completed my pilot training but was close to taking my check ride. It was a hard sell but I convinced the FBO at Spring Valley, New York, just North of the George Washington Bridge, to qualify me for solo flight there  and I could complete my solo and cross country time. Spring Valley&#039;s single runway ran East to West and unlike your airport was littered with ops shacks, maintenance hangers and the like and more often than not the prevailing wind was from the South. In the shadow of the Catskill Mountains it was gusty too. I had learned as a sail boater that the wind is often blocked by other boats, islands, trees all that stuff. There was no one to teach me, but I learned by necessity that cross wind landings required a little more speed and control in a steady breeze, never mind gusty conditions. The buildings provided a no wind situation just before and during transition then the wind would savage my 150 during the critical phase just before touchdown. (Gusty conditions)The crab came naturally. Mother is the necessity of invention, but most interestingly I was able to dope out that NO flaps really helped with control. I was flying the airplane down to the numbers. Other then short field situations that technique stayed with me and became part of my flying. I have never been criticized for it and it works well. In fact my check ride a few weeks later included a crosswind landing at Freeway Airport, (W00) ,  just East of  DCA in Arlington, Va. ]]></description>

Great video....as a CFI, I could spend hours explaining this......an online video, especially as seen from the tail of the aircraft is worth a 1000 words.
