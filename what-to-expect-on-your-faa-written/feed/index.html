		<description><![CDATA[Like Kevin, I used Sporty&#039;s Study Buddy app on my iPad. The study apps all use the same questions. One tip that I can give on that is for the sectional questions, use your fingers to match the scale on the map to the scale on your plotter&#039;s 1:500,000 scale. Then you can do your calculations. I was skipping those questions till it finally occurred to me to do that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I used the dauntless aviation FAA written preps on my PC and iPad to prepare for my private and IFR writtens.  Passed both in the high 90s..  The explanations they provide are far more detailed than those that I saw with gleim or asa books, so I really recommend the dauntless stuff.  As far as what was on the tests I took, it was a real mix of a little bit of everything and I suspect that those who write about it featuring this or that are overgeneralizing from the random distribution of questions they happen to have gotten on their particular test.   About ndb questions: not only are there still plenty of NDBs worldwide, but the general spacial orientation principles associated with working out NDB problems are applicable to thinking about navigation properly.  I personally think that learning to fly NDB approaches properly during my IFR training made me a better GPS pilot, for example.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Weather too can be a big deal on the written tests. Like Jason said, xcountry is huge. I use the Gleim prep books, because of the great explanations. Kinda funny that the faa still brings in those ndb questions. My instructor says they put em&#039; in there just to give you something to do :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[During my recent checkride (partial anyway - I opted not to fly due to high winds so was issued a discontinuance. Possible future video topic?) the first thing the examiner said was &quot;Wow 94% on the written. I like to see that.&quot; The actual oral was about an hour and a half but I think he spent more time sharing neat little-known tricks of better/safer flying than he did testing me. Seemed that way anyway. For example, he shared tips for quickly estimating an in-flight diversion and for setting up the perfect pattern (with appropriate altitudes AGL at each point) for landing. Don&#039;t get me wrong, he asked hard questions but I could probably count the number of questions on two hands.  Maybe his philosophy was that since I scored well on the written and I was able to answer all (well most :) of his hard questions that I demonstrated acceptable understanding of the required PTS topics? Not sure, but I will tell you this - it was such a privileged to sit there and soak up the 50+ years and 10&#039;s of thousands of hrs of aviation wisdom he was sharing. So cool. I look forward to finishing next week (E. Kansas weather permitting of course :). 

Long story longer - take the written seriously. Its not just a gate to the next step in your training, it sets the stage for a confident checkride and of course being a safer pilot.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My question is the FAA, the law requires that you get 70% or better to pass,now assuming one passes with 75% what not.It may have been that he or she went into the exam casually,didn`t sleep well,had too much anxiety,or some other reason.It doesn`t necessarily make him  a bad pilot or a non knowledgeable one so technically if he or she has passed by law ,does that give the right for an examiner to overly scrutinize him for it or fail him.I would think that would be unfair or unjust.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jason,
I also took the written about a month ago.  I remembered that you said, several times, to do well on the written or you may get a more difficult oral exam on check ride. My goal was to be into the 90&#039;s..hopefully &#062;95%.
I used Sporty&#039;s Study Buddy test prep. Study Buddy breaks the ~750 questions into 35 categories, ranging from 4 questions (Advisory Circulars) to 122 questions (FAR part 91).
I just kept testing in each of the 35 categories, keeping score/focusing on the areas of weakness, until I had each category down, cold. I soon saw that I had memorized most of the questions/answers and did not even need to do any calc&#039;s and analyses.
I scored 97% on the written, and completed the test in ~1hr vs the 2.5 hrs allotted.  I did not experience any test anxiety, probably because I was confident that I was gonna do well. 
Of the 2 questions I got wrong, one was a careless mistake...measured nav distance using the wrong scale (sm vs km).
The other one I got wrong was related to an airport marking...that question was not included in the Study Buddy data base of questions for some reason.
I studied frequently in the months prior to the test (Rod Machado&#039;s book). 
When it came to crunch time, in the 3-4 weeks prior to the test, I spent ~3 hrs x 3 times/week working on the Study Buddy prep as described.
I do not recall any one or 2 major areas of focus on the test..just a random mix of nav, weather, regs, etc.  Make sure you know where Oklahoma, Utah, Kentucky, Michigan, Indiana, Texas are on the map,  There are questions that ask why IFR and other conditions exist over those states.
Hope this helps others,
Kevin]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I believe that the area a student should study in more detail is the area that is not liked.  Most students will excel in the areas they like or enjoy studying. They do poorly in those areas they deem difficult or not interesting to them.  This veries from student to student and the instructor should be able to determine this. I prefer to study the FAA handbooks, on the particular subject, from cover to cover and note what areas I think are not as interesting as others.  I then spend additional time on those areas.  By the way, it works for me, I scored 100% on my private and am now trying to obtain 100% on my FOI, BGI, IGI, and AGI.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have 4 areas that I concentrate on. Navigation, weather, systems/instruments and FAR&#039;s. Of the 60 questions about 15-20% will guaranteed be about weather. Think about it that is about 10 questions right there. I have taken about 8 written tests and I always will get a fog and thunderstorm question. I really go over sectional charts and learn as much as I can about legend symbols and airspace.
Let me give you all some test taking suggestions because I have taken plenty. Read each question twice. First to get a general understand of what they are asking and second read it slowly to get each meaning of every word. Then immediately eliminate two of the answers. Two will be pretty close but one of them will be more right. I never change answers once I decide. If you get stuck come back. I have found that usually there will be a question that is similar or some supplemental info is provided that will make the light bulb to go off later in the test. Last each question has the same value. I save all the calculating landing distances on grass fields and density altitude with a given weight for last.

I will usually do some exercising before each test. I will have a protein bar and lemonade. When I cannot remember I look up not down. There have been studies that show better connections in the brain. Sorry for the long comment.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Jason, my best advice is to expect all questions. Too many student pilots go into both the FAA written and check ride with a 70% mentality. If your not studying for 100%, your cheating yourself. Please keep the skies safe, learn as much as possible, and be an example for civil aviation.
