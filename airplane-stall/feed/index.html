		<description><![CDATA[Hi there! Im from Australia (perth) and my first ever stall was scary! the nose went down so we were actually facing the ground (50 degrees) i am only 14 and really working on these stalls, to make them not scary for me! ever since that stall i have been scared of them! Your video definately helped!! Thankyou!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My first experience I felt like &#039;wheeee!&#039;  I was in a Warrior II, and did a full power-on stall, the nose rolled over to the right (had the right rudder to the floor) and pitched probably 50 degrees down (at least it felt that way), I relaxed the rudder, levelled the wings and recovered.  Not scary at all, just like a roller coaster, and a great experience to have behind me.  Practicing recoveries is definitely an important part of training, so don&#039;t put it off!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My instructor is the one who repeated the stall can happen at **any** airspeed and encouraged me to read more about it. The flight school owner also does his best to transfer his considerable knowledge to the students.

This reminds me of the Practical Test Standards that mention a +/- of around 10 in airspeed( I don&#039;t have my book in front of me) for steep turns. I think it was written that way to reinforce  you don&#039;t want your speed to degrade during the turn causing a stall. 

Steep turns are really fun now that I know how to execute one. My instructor always challenges me to aim for zero altitude deviation all while making sure to keep looking inside and outside the plane. I&#039;m looking forward to the video of you demonstrating steep turns. :)

Best,

You&#039;re very right. It SO IMPORTANT to keep that ball centered otherwise you might get some unwanted spin training!

		<description><![CDATA[I think I was shaking more than the airplane was buffeting during my first stall.  Then once it happened, I realized just how benign they really are... as long as you stay coordinated.

And that is where I think most pilots&#039; apprehension comes from.  They know they can recover as long as they stay coordinated, but what about if they don&#039;t?  

Well that is what spin training is for!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[haha Thanks Mike!

You hit the nail on the head with your comment!

You have to keep the airplane coordinated! You greatly decrease the risk of a spin if you can keep that ball centered.

		<description><![CDATA[Steve,

An Aerobat is a GREAT airplane to practice that sort of stuff in. I love what you said &quot;After all it wants to fly&quot;

That is so true! These aircraft WILL KEEP FLYING. Thus rendering stalls not as nerve wrenching as we once thought

		<description><![CDATA[Jason, that was an excellent tutorial, just excellent in my opinion. More clearly explained probably than many students get from their instructors initially. Really emphasize though keeping the ball centered, being coordinated. 
Although I passed my checkride last summer, wish I&#039;d had the benefit of seeing this video prior to my first stall training.  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jason,

Excellent explanation of the subject. Years back, I was very nervous about stalls, and as it was years of no flying since my previous bi-annual review, some of those old fears have tried to reassert themselves. I did some aerobatic training to combat my fear be making the airplane do these unusual behaviors, so I could grow accustomed to what the airplane would do. I made the instructor teach me stalls, and we went up in an Aerobat. I was very nervous about an uncoordinated stall, because my first instructor always was very alarmed about my not being exactly coordinated in the stall. So we went up and spun that Aerobat until I was satisfied. The C150 is very hard to spin, and you have to really want to, or it just won&#039;t do it. the most I could get it to do was 1.5 to 2 spins at the most- then it would come out all on its own- even with me trying to hold it in. But the number one thing that alleviated my fear was not doing the stalls themselves, but in flying paper airplanes and rubber powered model airplanes. They naturally go up, stall, dip down and continue flying. So I think of that, and let the airplane do the same while I am flying. And, I try to focus my mind on &#039;feeling&#039; what the airplane is doing. Tune into the airplane, and it will not surprise you. After all, it wants to fly.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mark,

Like you touched on the most important thing is that an instructor explains what the heck a stall is first.

You&#039;re right when you say that most people are doing stalls wrong...well in the sense that they pull back too much as you said.

I teach...select a pitch and hold it then adjust accordingly.

Awesome comment man!

		<description><![CDATA[Vincent,

I remember the picture you showed me of the 202 Bravo. It just LOOKS like it would have a nasty stall break! But 1,000 ft?!? That&#039;s nuts.

Thanks for sharing

		<description><![CDATA[Minimum is 1,500ft I believe in the video I was a few hundred above. I&#039;m very comfy with 512R having thousands of hours in it I know it doesn&#039;t &quot;break&quot; hard at all when it actually does stall.

Any other airplane i&#039;m not so comfy with we&#039;re doing them at 3,000 ft

		<description><![CDATA[Thomas,

What you said is something every pilot should know. &quot;A Stall CAN happen at any airspeed.&quot;

Dude you&#039;re awesome thank you for taking the time to run through your procedure. Sounds like you&#039;re one heck of a pilot I can tell just by how precise you are in your procedures. Keep the valuable comments coming. I love it!
