		<description><![CDATA[No, Jason, it&#039;s not a service I use due to nothing more than &quot;mike fright.&quot; I keep trying to muster up rhe courage and berate myself for being so silly, but I still can&#039;t do it.

Hey, thank you so much for your service to the pilot community. It is a very kind thing for you to do these videos and make them available to whomever. Thank you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Most FBOs (read insurance companies) will REQUIRE a FP. However, a VFR FP is like kissing your sister. It never gets to a controller. (Most CFIs don&#039;t know this). The FSS keeps it in a drawer in case you come up missing. That&#039;s why, if your really go down, you ARE going to spend the night on the ground (unless you crash very close to civilization). It&#039;s much more practical, and useful to ask for flight following. An IFR FP is handled differently, and in fact goes to the controllers. However, they NEVER see your filed alternate. Again, that&#039;s like kissing your sister. It&#039;s just there to make you go through the fuel planning exercise and to give you an initial choose when things start to go sour.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Flight plan?? 

Why would anyone ever file a VFR flight plan?  Better than nothing I guess.  They start looking for you 30 minuets after you should have reached your destination!!!!

Give me flight following every time. I never leave home without it.

By the time you are on the beach they will have a field full of first responders waiting.

Keep the greasy side down.

Best,

DH]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Jason, my name is Sam and im a commercial pilot in NC.  I stumbled across your website one afternoon and I was watching your video on jet transitions when you referenced N5BM.  A friend of mine just bought a 1980 Archer N5BM that iv been flying recently and I thought it was so strange to hear that you have fown it.  White and black paint, 496 mounted in the panel with weather, gs430.... same one??  Hope to hear back from you soon!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Dave, you did the right thing. BTW, although most FBOs/schools require a VFR flight plan for XC flight, the controller never gets a copy of it, only the FSS, and they only use it to search for you if you don&#039;t turn up and close your flight plan. Just using flight following is both easier, and safer IMHO. It&#039;s different for IFR flight, that flight plan is transmitted to controllers.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ Thanks for all your good work on the blog.  Great info for pilots.  A minor suggestion re hand offs: the term &quot;with you&quot; is not necessary or recommended language.  On busy frequencies, best to always use minimum words. so recommended practice is not to say &quot;with you&quot; when you check in.  Tail and &quot;level 5 thousand&quot; is all you need to say. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The video was good. I don&#039;t say as much as you did though. When being 
handed off from one controller to another, I repeat back the frequency, n
 number and add &quot;good day / thank you&quot;. On the new frequency, I listen 
for a couple of seconds and say airspace(eg Norcal), n number, altitude,
 and if I am level, climbing, or descending(most of the time I&#039;m level).
 





On a side note, the ATC folks in my area are GREAT. All but one 
conversation, I&#039;ve had has been positive with many ATC folks making sure
 I&#039;m aware of traffic. It is just awesome to have another person helping
 keep me safe; it&#039;s how a pilot can utilize ALL of his/her resources. 





It also seems to help if you make the call in a nice steady even tone of
 voice and not too fast similar to what you demonstrated. 





Don&#039;t forget, everyone can always ask the departing controller to 
&quot;repeat&quot; or &quot;say again&quot; to confirm one has the right frequency to change
 over to. Plus, the sectional sometimes has the new frequency printed 
right there for you to read. 





My instructor always wants me to know where I am while flying and to 
watch the GPS, sectional and most of all scan the outside airspace where
 you are going to fly next. I can hear him saying, &quot;don&#039;t get 
complacent&quot; what are you going to need / do next?





Thanks for posting this as it reminds me to review past experiences and keep on learning. :)

You&#039;ll need to notify of any altitude changes or course deviations


as well as fly a &quot;plus 500&quot; altitude
