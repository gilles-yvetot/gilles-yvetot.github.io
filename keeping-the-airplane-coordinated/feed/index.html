		<description><![CDATA[My first two lessons at the beginning of training are SOLELY by looking outside, feeling and listening to what you and the aircraft are doing. I stole a technique from Ralph Butcher in teaching a student to look outside. I took a manila folder, punched some holes in it and stuck it on the panel of a C-152. It covered up all the instruments. I have the students do turns, climbs and descents. If the student is doing a right turn, both the airplane and the students gludeus maximus (rear end) should be going right, with his rear not going left. I call it your &quot;rear&quot; turn coordinator. That&#039;s true flying by the seat of your pants. Then later we incorporate the instruments for precision purposes. Easy stuff and it works. I can prove it to you if you come down to KARB some Saturday morning. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One way to help develop the &#039;feel&#039; is to, with an instructor, do several shallow uncoordinated turn in both directions to learn how that feels, and then do the same with the rudder to notice the difference.  Once you identify the different feelings, it becomes easier to maintain awareness of your level of coordination.]]></description>
