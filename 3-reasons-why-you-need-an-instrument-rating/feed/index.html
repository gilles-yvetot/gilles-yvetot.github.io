		<description><![CDATA[Safety really is the biggest reason to get your IFR rating. 

Fact is that if you fly enough, you WILL encounter a situation where you&#039;re up in the air and have to deal with a change in the weather. It&#039;s not a matter of if, just when. You will then have to make some very hard, very dangerous decisions on how to proceed. And you may end up in a no-win situation. You may survive... but not before declaring an emergency and having a lot of explaining to do to the FAA once on the ground. 

On the other hand, all of this can be avoided with an instrument ticket. It will save your life and possibly your license as well. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While I&#039;ve enjoyed the instrument portion of my PPL training, I wouldn&#039;t even consider getting an instrument rating until and unless I own an IFR-certified aircraft. Besides the expense of renting to meet currency requirements, just the amount of IFR flying in general is a lot, I don&#039;t know if I want to make half of my flights IFR flights just to maintain currency. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The reason I got my instrument rating is because I am a career track pilot. I can list a few things that benefited my flying as a result of being instrument rated. Instrument training requires one to &quot;fly by the numbers&quot; this helped a lot in not only my instrument training, but my VFR flying as well. Especially during traffic pattern operations I am now paying more attention to locking in certain power settings, airspeeds, etc. so that my approaches are always consistant. Instrument training also enabled me to be a smooth operator in flying and gave me a whole new meaning to letting the airplane do the job. I am not talking about auto pilot here. What I am referring to is, using power settings, trim, and smooth control inputs while flying. It makes all kinds of flying easy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I figured I&#039;d get an IFR rating &quot;eventually&quot;, but 6 months after I got my Private my CFI(I) challenged me to get going on it.  Within a week I was building hours up and down the Sacramento Valley.  I knew that with fog always a winter factor in the valley, and the desire to take trips to the coast that an IFR rating could &quot;save the day&quot; by either allowing me to get out, or get home those last thousand feet in the fog.  Withinn  a few months of getting my IFR ticket, it did save the day because it allowed me to take someone to Monterey for the day, we wouldn&#039;t have made it in if I hadn&#039;t had my rating and been current.  A blast to listen to my passenger say &quot;I knew we&#039;d get close to the ground, but I didn&#039;t know how close&quot; (for the record we broke out at 500&#039; agl).  It was also fun to listen to the tower tell a Untied Express to hold for the Skyhawk on the ILS :)

Jason, love what you are doing with your programs, I totally agree that a good pilot is always learning.

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t have a IFR rating, but consider it.
However, I am 71 years old, have not flown much in the past years.
I was told I was not too old to get the IFR.....
Cost is always a factor, especially now with cost being high and climbing.
What would you suggest in testing the waters of IFR?

I like you videos, they simplify and clarify the reasons for making or taking an approach to flying.
Thank you]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Safety, of course, is paramount, but for anyone who flies for business purposes to get to meetings, an instrument rating is crucial. There are some days where the weather isn&#039;t bad, it&#039;s just not good. Rather than push the very limits of VFR flying and possibly get yourself into some trouble, the instrument rating will let you get to that meeting safely. That&#039;s sure better than postponing your meeting.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have many reasons but I will keep it simple. I fly in Michigan. With my private I was flying sometimes as little as once every 3 months and was barely able to keep current. So the IFR rating gave me an opportunity for more flying time. The IFR training makes you a better, safer and confident pilot. Your skill and knowledge increases dramatically. You say it best, &quot;it makes you a better pilot.&quot; I found I did not deviate from assigned altitudes, my turns, climbs and descents were tremendously smoother. Most of all through attitude and power settings for each configuration flying was a breeze. I challenge anyone to tell me that getting the Instrument ticket did not help their flying. It is another &quot;tool in your flying toolbox.&quot; I have taken my Instrument rating to a different level. I am a CFI pursuing the CFII. Why you might ask? My training for my instrument rating was terrible. No consistency in instructors, many cancellations due to the CFII flying corporate charters. I passed only by sheer survival. I am learning now how to be an instrument pilot while also learning how to teach it. What a crazy concept. I must also thank Jason because his How to pass the Instrument oral checkride is a reference that helps to pass the practical but also is like having a textbook that can be used from day one of training. I know, because that is how I have used it. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I know that I would like to get my IR in the near future.  One of my primary reasons is for the advanced/continued training to help make me a better and more confident pilot.  I love to always learn new things, and mixing that with flying makes it all that much better.

The insurance discount will be nice as well, finding a way to make flying and ownership just a little bit cheaper.

A great video, it makes me want to go fly.  Too bad my Cherokee is still undergoing its annual inspection.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I own a share in a 172 in Arizona; when it&#039;s not VFR (one day a year) it&#039;s not safe to fly a 172 here. Since I&#039;m not interested in a larger plane I&#039;m happy with VFR (though agree with safety considerations)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jason, that clip reminded me when I did my PPL exam and had to show the instructor the instruments component. We have simulated it under the hood which I was fine with, but when I did it in reality I actually realised that its not as easy as being under the hood. It wasn&#039;t just exam stress but the feeling of you do not know where you are and not whats in front of you... I really wanna do it as I will never know when I am going to need it...Justin Case is a new friend...&quot; Just  In Case&quot; i need at the least expected time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Like the comment about &quot;Fogged in&quot;..that is so true...when we are VFR...sometimes it is hours before clearing.  That said,  I read an article stating that there is a &#039;new&#039; FAA    VFR/IFR  combined requirement standard as of August? I think their attempt is to phase out some of the redundency tasks. Have you heard anything n this? Any comments?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[More flying days and increased safety are definitely up there. In terms of aircraft control though I feel like instrument flight really forces you to stay on top of the aircraft more precisely than VFR and that skill is valuable even when in severe blue.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just about done with my instrument rating. I am doing it for safety sake as well as my passengers. We all know clear and million is about as smooth as a gravel road, and with my wife&#039;s motion sickness cloudy and calm will be way more pleasant for her. The thrill of breaking out on top the clouds is nothing to the thrill of breaking out near mins on an ILS  and seeing the runway right where it should be. Good times.]]></description>
