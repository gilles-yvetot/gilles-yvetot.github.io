		<description><![CDATA[I agree with Jason, and too some extent Wmarshall61.  Ok, an adjustable wrench may not be the preferred tool, but is acceptable, if used correctly. Cynical comments are not justified.  Two tools that should NEVER be used on aircraft, channel locks and ordinary pliers. They mar what you are grabbing with them.   Jason in his videos has always stressed to have a mechanic show and help the first time.    A big part of learning to be a pilot or an A&#038;P is on the job training,  a certificate is  a  certificate  learn.   If you are to be good and excel at what you do, your are ALWAYS LEARNING.  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Safety wire pliers are good, but you should learn to safety wire by hand also.  A lttle technique to safety wiring.    Hold the pliers after making the last twist, pull wire tight,then make a circular motion with your hand.  This cinches the first twist up tight against the nut, bolt, etc.  Due the same on the pigtail.  One warning do it no more then twice, you work harden the wire and it may then break.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Robert,

Thanks for the link above and great comment. You&#039;re so correct. Not only are you preventing puncture wounds but also making it safer.

Proper tools such as safety wire pliers are also a must to really get the job done

		<description><![CDATA[Ohhh Where to start...

First off I appreciate your comment what I don&#039;t appreciate is your cynical undertones...Quote (It is great that you share these videos with everyone. Now everyone can be as unsafe as you. )

Your input and information is correct and valuable. You don&#039;t have to be rude about it.

But let&#039;s look at the big picture you&#039;re missing...

This video is titled &quot;Aircraft oil change&quot; not &quot;The comprehensive guide to changing your oil in a 1975 150M&quot;

Let me explain... After talking with several DPE&#039;s last week they were going on and on about how they had a handful of students that didn&#039;t know what preventive maintenance was and didn&#039;t even have a clue that someone other than a mechanic could work on the airplane.

This video was done to say &quot;hey, you can do this kind of stuff, get out there and work on your aircraft with you mechanic, learn the ins and outs of the airplane you&#039;re flying.&quot;

Brad left a great comment below saying the only look he ever got in his flight school of the engine was through the oil door!

I&#039;m simply educating flight students not teaching them to be A&#038;P&#039;s

I really agree with you that some safety should have been worked in there. All your points were very valid.

Again I really appreciate your comment. But let&#039;s leaving snide comments behind.

		<description><![CDATA[Jason,

First of all I would like to say GOOD video. Too bad you didn&#039;t incoporate some safety into it. 

1. You should always insure the aircraft is safe to work on. Keys out and maybe the battery disconnected.

2. Always wear safety goggles when working around oil. Especially hot oil and cutting safety wire.

3. Use the proper tools for the job. You metioned the 5/8&#039;s wrench and used an adjustable wrench. A torque wrench for installing the oil strainer? Consult the manual for correct torque.

4. Never wear rings or any jewlery when working around aircraft. If the battery is not disconnected, you may short on any wires that may be close and in need of repair.

 And cleaning the sparkplugs? This could have been another video on its own.

It is great that you share these vidoes with everyone. Now everyone can be as unsafe as you.

You do an excellent job with your fight training videos. I&#039;m not sure if you are a qualified A&#038;P. Alot of young pilots watch these videos and this one sends the wrong message.

Thanks for reading.

		<description><![CDATA[Please learn how to safety  wire correctly.   I have been an A&#038;P for over thirty years, and a Maintenance inspector for an airline.   Please LEARN to bend the pig tail!    I don&#039;t know how many times I have reached into a tight space, only to be jabbed by a unbent or slightly bent pig tail on a poor safety wiring job.  There is nothing like the feeling the jab of safety wire going into  into your arm or hand, and know the only thing to do is pull you hand/arm back and hope it does rip to much.  Besides making it painless for the next time, bending and tucking the back  against itself, safeties the end of  the twist and prevents it from unraveling ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Matt,

Well... I&#039;ve got a few good burn scars to show you! Mostly from mufflers and such. Actually funny story....

Just drained the oil and left the bucket under the strainer in case any extra dripped out while pulling the plugs one dropped and made 10 point Gold Medal dive into the oil.

Digging for a spark plug in 5 quarts of boiling oil was not fun

But it did save the plug :) if it would have hit the hanger floor she could have been done.

So yes it&#039;s Hot. Like fresh off a good 1 hour training flight hot

		<description><![CDATA[Mike,

It&#039;s still and oil filter however what you&#039;re thinking of is a &quot;spin-on&quot; oil filter which almost every aircraft has now.

There is an STC for the 150 to have a spin on and it actually increases my oil change time to every 50 hours instead of every 25.

The proper term for it I believe is &quot;oil screen&quot; as it&#039;s just cleaned and put back in there. Although I call it an oil filter in the video.

		<description><![CDATA[Brad!

Wonderful Insights!

Man don&#039;t owner assisted annuals teach you so much? I love doing them. I hate when my airplane is on the ground (especially my business/flight training aircraft) but nothing is more fun then working on something you own or fly. My students really love it and learn so much.

So Sorry! I realized we never captured that footage.

But couldn&#039;t safety wire be a video all in itself? :) I still screw it up!!!

		<description><![CDATA[The only part of my 172 trainer I&#039;ve seen has been viewed through the tiny little door while checking the oil.  Fortunately, I have had the opportunity to help a friend with some owner assisted annuals, which has really taught me a LOT about aircraft systems.  I HIGHLY recommend this type of exposure to other students.  If I were a CFI, I think touring under the cowl would be even more beneficial than touring a control tower.

Also, it&#039;s important to get the oil hot before you drain it not only to ease the draining, but more importantly, any sludge/particulate/whatever settles out of solution and does not drain well that way.  Warming and circulating the oil ensures you get all that junk into solution just prior to draining so you can get it out.]]></description>
