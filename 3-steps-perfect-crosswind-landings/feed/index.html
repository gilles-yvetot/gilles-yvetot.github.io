		<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s some tips:

Left crosswinds are easier, start there. You&#039;re probably already in a sideslip unless you know to counter nose-down P-factor with left rudder. Since most pilots don&#039;t do that, they tend to have the left wing slightly down as they start the round out. Also, nearly every pilot yaws left in the flare (due to nose-up P-factor) so even if you can&#039;t get the plane straight you&#039;re probably nearer to the centerline.

Embry Riddle has it right: their students fly all the way down final in a goofy sideslip. How else are you going to learn to control a plane in a sideslip? If I were a CFI, I&#039;d have my students correcting their runway alignment with sideslips instead of coordinated turns. When they got  good at it, then I&#039;d let them try some crosswinds. When they got good at that, I&#039;d finally show them crab-and-slip.]]></description>
