I would also state that asking questions for anything that doesn&#8217;t make sense.  There are so many things that we need to learn, and when an instructor would state something, I would basically shake my head (in agreement) and not have a clue on what they were talking about.  It slowed my training, and cost me a lot more than needed. It also took longer to get the additional ratings because I had to learn what I missed the 1st time around. Learn the fundementals and ask questions.  There are no stupid questions!! Remember we are paying for instruction and instruction means to pass on your knowledge. </p>

an individual that I really gelled with. <br />
If I could have gone with a different FBO – that would have been a<br />
benefit.  Planes were often not available<br />
even though I had them scheduled for months – if it could make more money on<br />
another mission then it was gone.  If<br />
there was an option of a flying club or partial ownership – I’d have much<br />
rather gone that route.  I am a big guy<br />
so a 152 wasn’t even an option – I’ve sunk quite a bit in rental fees that I<br />
would rather have in an aircraft that was the same every time.  Same NavComm, same climb, same cruise – of the<br />
three 172’s I did my training in – they all seem to perform differently and<br />
each time I got in I had to relearn the idiosyncrasies of the avionics.  Now I am working on my instrument and am not<br />
using an FBO – I am using my company’s plane and a CFII that I have a direct<br />
relationship with,  not through an<br />
FBO.  </p>

<p>I did the same thing you did, right out of high school, I would drive 80 miles (one way) to go fly.  I tried to home school myself (unsuccessfully), work full time,  and fly every chance I could; I managed to do more flying than studying.   Given a do over I would do the formal ground school along with the flying.</p>

That way I could see where my money is going, more importantly, when I change CFI (I had three CFIs) I can show him/her where to pick up my training and keep moving forward.</p>
<p>The first two CFIs got hired by an airline. As Jason mentioned, find out about the CFI&#8217;s goals, there&#8217;s nothing wrong with building time while waiting for an opportunity on an airline, but make sure that when he/she is hired, you won&#8217;t be left hanging without notice, as it happened to me.</p>

Some didn&#8217;t want to fly if there was a cloud in the sky.  Luckily about that time a friend bought and airplane and invited me to use it to get my license, so I went shopping for a flight instructor.  With a good, consistent instructor I finally soloed and cranked through my PPL in the following two months.</p>

&#8211; I would paid more attention to my ground school<br />
&#8211; I would have done more self-studying at home to save money with ground instruction <br />
&#8211; I would have flown a cheaper airplane (i.e. C-152/C-150) instead of thinking big.</p>
<p>on my private pilot license I made plenty of mistakes that cost me a lot of money. So watch out for those things. I know instructors are not there to take every penny you got, but for the wanna-be pilots, do your homework and don&#8217;t expect the flight instructor to spoon feed you all the information.</p>
<p>another big thing I could have done different was:<br />
&#8211; I would not have gotten a loan out for flight training. At least not for the Private. </p>
<p>My goal in aviation is to become an Airline pilot. I started flying I was 20 yrs old. Right now I&#8217;m currently working on my Instrument. I hold my private single &amp; multi &#8211; engine. Next step is Commercial for me then maybe instructor to build hours.</p>
<p>So I hope my experience serve to help someone out there.<br />
Cheers. </p>
<p>Jason, by the way, you are such a good important person in the GA world that you deserve a VOR here in Florida named after you. Or maybe an airport. haha.<br />
Thanks for taking your time to share videos and information with us.<br />
I miss the webbinars. Come up with a new one quick. Thanks!</p>

He wasn&#8217;t a &#8220;technique&#8221; instructor who actually gave you the how too&#8217;s and why&#8217;s. The instructor I now is a HOW TO instructor!

 I would definately rent only a cessna 150/152 to reduce hourly rental rates&#8230; I would also consider training at a non-towered airport (it might hurt you on communication skills) because you can get so many more times around the pattern than in a busy class d or c airport&#8230; this will give you more take-offs and landings in one hour which will help you get more done faster&#8230; And then jump immediately into IFR training asap after PPL is achieved. A lot of the info is the same, you might as well because the info is still fresh in your head&#8230;<br />

If I hadn&#8217;t already completed my ground study, I&#8217;d be in your on line ground school for sure. If I had to add one thing, I&#8217;d say to begin every lesson by asking what it is you&#8217;re supposed to learn or accomplish that day, and then verifying after the lesson that you had learned or accomplished that objective, or if not, why not.  And one other thing, if you have a lesson on a day when you don&#8217;t feel up to learning the objective, don&#8217;t be afraid to suggest to your instructor that you&#8217;d rather just go flying on a short x-c, or do turns around a point, or whatever, and have fun with it. Yes, it will cost you a little money and take a little longer, but so will busting your tail and getting nowhere and not even enjoying it. </p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-5892" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I&#8217;ve made this recommendation to many prospective flight students over the years.  Find one or two friends who want to learn to fly and you cut the cost significantly. Right after getting my CFI I bought a Cherokee 140 with two friends who wanted to learn to fly. I had a cheap time-builder and they had a cheap trainer. Both cruised through their lessons in no time. BY having your own airplane you eliminate scheduling problems, you have a consistent plane you&#8217;re flying in, you can fly more often and thus finish sooner.  I have a student now who&#8217;s flying a friend&#8217;s C-150 and he&#8217;s the only one flying it currently. It&#8217;s available anytime he has a little time to fly. We&#8217;ll finish his license in under six weeks at the rate that we&#8217;re going.</p>

<p>First, at the end of each lesson, be sure you know what the next lesson is going to cover. That&#8217;s something I do with my students, and I think it helps.</p>
<p>Second,  if one is available, do the lessons first in an AATD.  The flight school at KMKC that I sometimes teach out of has a FlyIt simulator that has about a 200 degree field of view.  Its not a full motion sim, but the next best thing.  The owner of the flight school has told me they&#8217;ve seen consistently less time( close to 40 hours ) in the airplane to private.  Plus, the weather&#8217;s always VFR in the sim!  I&#8217;ve used it for one of my students, and, while he&#8217;s just starting out, I think its helping him.  </p>

<p>I&#8217;m 18 years old and just got my private certificate about a month ago. If I could have went back I would have really got into my far/aim a bit better, especially part 61.109 just to get a better outline of the required training&#8230; I was always relying on my instructor and asking him what we should do when sometimes its in the students best intrest/budget to suggest things to the instructor on what should be done on a particular day. </p>

<p>If I could go back and do anything differently, I would have occasionally taken up a different instructor just to get a better review of my current abilities.  The first time I did this, the second instructor I went up with for a single lesson picked out a flaw in my landing technique that my regular instructor never noticed.  Looking back, I should have done that a few extra times.</p>

I ask students up front what they want to do once they get their Private Pilot rating and hot they want to get there. I also ask what their work schedule is and availability. I proceed to let them know my work schedule and availability. If this works for their needs, wants and goals and they agree with my teaching style we proceed. If they want to fly 2-3 times a week, including weekends I let them know I would be available after a certain time (1600) M-Fri and available all times on weekends. If they want to fly during the day I refer them to full time instructors. I also tell them that once we start I am fully committed to their learning and if they are not getting their most bang for their hard earned buck I will refer them to another instructor. I become their mentor and instructor and only think about their learning to fly safely, efficiently and most of all have fun. I always stress the continuation of the learning process. I always send my students articles, videos and even let them sit in the the back seat during my training sessions (CFII) to see that their instructor is always learning also. They love to see their instructor make mistakes and learn from them too.  So far in the 4 years I have been a CFI, I have a 100% passrate and happy former students that keep coming back for refresher. Thanks for the great work that you do and giving us CFI a fantastic reference site. Since I am new to your site and want to add to my Private Pilot Syllabus as a required reading your How to Pass the Oral Checkride. Glad to see you on your MAC as I do all my presentations on my MacBook Pro. Keep it coming Sir!<br />

My flight school offers a lot of resources like ground school, and frequent safety seminars. Because I was 15, I just wanted to get in the air and learn that way. I did learn, however, I think I would have benefited more if I had started at a younger age, where I would have had more time on my hands to do things like ground school, and attend different seminars. I also feel that if I started at a younger age, I would have been able to rack up a lot of hours that I don&#8217;t have now. I plan to become an airline pilot, and I will further my training as necessary.</p>
