		<description><![CDATA[Nice video. I think it is very profitable
to join a pilot training program. There are so many aviation academies are
providing various pilot training and ATP training courses. To eliminate the
tension of paying high training fees; these flight academies also provide
various scholarship programs and education loan facilities to their pilot
trainees.

		<description><![CDATA[Excellent point on the flight instructors.  When I learned, I went through four instructors in the first dozen hours and three months of lessons. Some didn&#039;t want to fly if there was a cloud in the sky.  Luckily about that time a friend bought and airplane and invited me to use it to get my license, so I went shopping for a flight instructor.  With a good, consistent instructor I finally soloed and cranked through my PPL in the following two months.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve made this recommendation to many prospective flight students over the years.  Find one or two friends who want to learn to fly and you cut the cost significantly. Right after getting my CFI I bought a Cherokee 140 with two friends who wanted to learn to fly. I had a cheap time-builder and they had a cheap trainer. Both cruised through their lessons in no time. BY having your own airplane you eliminate scheduling problems, you have a consistent plane you&#039;re flying in, you can fly more often and thus finish sooner.  I have a student now who&#039;s flying a friend&#039;s C-150 and he&#039;s the only one flying it currently. It&#039;s available anytime he has a little time to fly. We&#039;ll finish his license in under six weeks at the rate that we&#039;re going.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I started flight training when I was 15 years old at a little municipal airport in a small town. My flight school offers a lot of resources like ground school, and frequent safety seminars. Because I was 15, I just wanted to get in the air and learn that way. I did learn, however, I think I would have benefited more if I had started at a younger age, where I would have had more time on my hands to do things like ground school, and attend different seminars. I also feel that if I started at a younger age, I would have been able to rack up a lot of hours that I don&#039;t have now. I plan to become an airline pilot, and I will further my training as necessary.

		<description><![CDATA[Hello Jason, I am a part-time instructor, full time pharmacist, part time University instructor and lecturer. I ask students up front what they want to do once they get their Private Pilot rating and hot they want to get there. I also ask what their work schedule is and availability. I proceed to let them know my work schedule and availability. If this works for their needs, wants and goals and they agree with my teaching style we proceed. If they want to fly 2-3 times a week, including weekends I let them know I would be available after a certain time (1600) M-Fri and available all times on weekends. If they want to fly during the day I refer them to full time instructors. I also tell them that once we start I am fully committed to their learning and if they are not getting their most bang for their hard earned buck I will refer them to another instructor. I become their mentor and instructor and only think about their learning to fly safely, efficiently and most of all have fun. I always stress the continuation of the learning process. I always send my students articles, videos and even let them sit in the the back seat during my training sessions (CFII) to see that their instructor is always learning also. They love to see their instructor make mistakes and learn from them too.  So far in the 4 years I have been a CFI, I have a 100% passrate and happy former students that keep coming back for refresher. Thanks for the great work that you do and giving us CFI a fantastic reference site. Since I am new to your site and want to add to my Private Pilot Syllabus as a required reading your How to Pass the Oral Checkride. Glad to see you on your MAC as I do all my presentations on my MacBook Pro. Keep it coming Sir!

		<description><![CDATA[I knew one of the hardest parts for me in training would be not being able to fly because it was ground school day, so I completed all of my ground school work and took the written exam before starting the flying portion.  That allowed for me to fly as frequently as I wanted.

If I could go back and do anything differently, I would have occasionally taken up a different instructor just to get a better review of my current abilities.  The first time I did this, the second instructor I went up with for a single lesson picked out a flaw in my landing technique that my regular instructor never noticed.  Looking back, I should have done that a few extra times.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Jason,

I&#039;m 18 years old and just got my private certificate about a month ago. If I could have went back I would have really got into my far/aim a bit better, especially part 61.109 just to get a better outline of the required training... I was always relying on my instructor and asking him what we should do when sometimes its in the students best intrest/budget to suggest things to the instructor on what should be done on a particular day. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well if you look at it like this it speaks for its self.   If a 152 costs you $30K you can sell it when you are finished your training for about the same, not to mention you have it when you want it.   Availability is never an issue]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There are huge benefits to practicing on a PC type sim. I use X-Plane, doesn&#039;t matter which. The important point is to practice with a purpose, use Vx/Vy climbs, set power IAW POH, practice level off&#039;s, slow flight, stalls, all the maneuvers as if you were actually in the airplane. If don&#039;t have a sim,  you can achieve almost as much by chair flying.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What you train in is a matter of choice, but going directly from non-towered to IFR is too big a leap unless you get trained in a dense environment. I generally encourage going directly into IFR as soon as you have your 50 hours XC PIC, but you need exposure to an ATC environment.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jason,  I agree with all your points.  I had a couple thoughts.

First, at the end of each lesson, be sure you know what the next lesson is going to cover. That&#039;s something I do with my students, and I think it helps.

Second,  if one is available, do the lessons first in an AATD.  The flight school at KMKC that I sometimes teach out of has a FlyIt simulator that has about a 200 degree field of view.  Its not a full motion sim, but the next best thing.  The owner of the flight school has told me they&#039;ve seen consistently less time( close to 40 hours ) in the airplane to private.  Plus, the weather&#039;s always VFR in the sim!  I&#039;ve used it for one of my students, and, while he&#039;s just starting out, I think its helping him.

		<description><![CDATA[Here in Georgia, during the hotter months,weather patterns tend to be more volatile and severe in the later hours of the day. If I could start over again, I would schedule as many training sessions as I could for earlier in the day when inclement conditions would be less likely to occur.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Get involved and stay involved.  Find a club or people to go flying with to share the costs. (Make sure you are complying with FARS)  Especially if you are getting your ticket and not planning to persue a career. Keep reading and keep learning.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I completely agree with Jason&#039;s advice and would only add one additional piece of advice:  Save enough money to complete your training prior to starting.  Budget for 60 flight hrs to be safe and if you learn quicker than that, you have money in the pot to go flying afterwards ;)
