		<description><![CDATA[I  will be doing my solo in about two weeks and I&#039;m very nervous.  My biggest problem is the lack of confidence in myself.  My instructor says I&#039;m to hard on myself.  The dream of becoming a pilot and working my way up to becoming a commercial pilot was one I&#039;ve had since I was very young but someone I thought I could trust convinced me that I would be wasting my time.  Today with the help of my loving wife the dream I once thought I put through my mental shredder is now a live and slowly coming true for me.   So now I have put so much pressure on myself because  I can let this dream slip away and I can not fail.  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just flew my first solo on 12/18.  Aside from the top door latch on my Warrior II not latching, it went perfect.  Made the first landing a full stop, corrected the door, then went back up for two more circuits.  Like others on here, I think those three landings were my best to date :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey there my name is John-Henry Lambin and I wanted to shar my first solo experience as it was quite the ride: it was on oct_22_2010; beautiful day when both my brother and I where scheduled to solo the same day. He went up first and set the pace to what was a vary high standard. Anyway long story very short it was then my tern, up at pattern altitude, thered and final cercute I was on L-downwind over the highway doing my prelanding check (ironically) when my engine failed on turn to base! Luckaly my instructor (whom I chairish dearly) always finished every leson with emergency engine-out training, so I was able (by the grace of god) to declar and emergency landing to clear traffic before I brought her down safely, &#038; I must say it was serenely the best landing I&#039;ve ever maid hah..

		<description><![CDATA[I soloed at KGGG - East Texas Regional - in 1977 - a towered airport. I remember having an issue with hearing the controller&#039;s instructions and flying the plane at the same time...Until the Instructor stepped out of the plane so I could solo. Then I held on to and heard every word spoken. I&#039;ve really never had an issue with towered environments since. Actually, I would rather fly into a towered Airport in class B Airspace than some of the uncontrolled fields where I have landed... ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[haha no Shawn, that would have done some damage to good ole&#039; 12R if that were the case.

If you watch it closely and listen you can see and hear it go left wheel, right wheel, nose wheel.

For that last landing the wind was picking up a hair and he executed a perfect crosswind landing.

Not bad for a first solo!

		<description><![CDATA[I will always remember my solo back in October 2000.  Yes I was nervous, but the interaction between ATC, a 747 pilot, and myself stands out.  I was at Ottawa International and was #1 for take off ( taxied in from the east) and on the other side of the runway a 747 had pulled up and was also ready to depart.  I jumped on the radio and informed ATC that I was ready to depart and was on my first solo.  ATC informed me that they were going to clear the &#039;heavy&#039; and then myself.  The 747 pilot responded that he was ahead of schedule and that &#039;he and his passengers&#039; were looking forward to witnessing my first solo.  Pretty amazing....but lots of pressure!!  My touchdown wasn&#039;t perfect but it did the job.  After touchdown, the 747 pilot came on the radio and conveyed his congratulations......ATC did the same and cleared the 747 to the active.  Priceless!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Michael,

haha better climb rate for sure! That&#039;s the first thing I tell my students... &quot;When I get my 6&#039;5 200lbs butt out of here this 150 is going to be like a rocket&quot;

But calming the nerves can be a tough one to combat. Like you said treat it like a normal flight.

		<description><![CDATA[I bet that student visits your blog so congrats to him as well!

I soloed on Sept 16 in 2008.  I remember being about the most nervous as I had ever been in my life.  My legs were shaking and I think my hands were too taxiing out.

I can ditto the Mike&#039;s observation below that that nervousness left later in the flight, but I think for me it was more around when I was at TPA.  Around that time I had been able to observe that everything was acting just like a normal flight, minus the better climb rate.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cool, I had my first solo this weekend on Sunday, 9/26.  I thought I would feel more anxious but it all went away once I left the ground and I was just doing what I knew how to do.  Also, I think my first landing of the three I did was probably the best landing I&#039;ve ever done.  ]]></description>
