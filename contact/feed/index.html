		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jason, I am also a CFI and I wanted to comment on the video you left about class D airspace. The point of making a radio call is to make it concise, to the point, and to get every bit of information in it that you need, as to not tie up the radios. I had a real problem with the way you contacted the ground controller at class D. First, you should not call up ground control to just see if your radio is working. Your first call should be all of the information that you are stating and requesting. If he or she does not answer, then you may make a general inquiry to ground. The second problem that I have is that you did not give the controller all of the information that you needed for flight following while stating your heading and altitude request. By doing this, you tied up the radios and ATC&#039;s radio time for awhile. What if someone would have called in with an emergency? Your excessive radio calls would have keep that from happening. So I am writing to tell you that I think you need to revise how you do radio calls. You are taking up way to much radio talk time and someday it might interfere with the real situation at hand. Keep it concise and to the point!

		<description><![CDATA[Jason,

Just came across your site and videos on YouTube and have to say that I am VERY impressed at your approach, professionalism and genuine REAL attitude.   You make things very clear to new student pilots and those wanting to brush up on their skills.  Great job!  Keep up the fantastic work!]]></description>
