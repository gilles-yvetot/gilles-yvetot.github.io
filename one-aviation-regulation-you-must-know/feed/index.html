		<description><![CDATA[Great explanation of a very vague rule! It&#039;s nice to see an actual list of things to check. Being prepared is so important, I&#039;ve always felt like being obsessive here isn&#039;t necessarily a bad thing. A few years back I was flying into South Lake Tahoe where they were repaving the runway and it was closed. The NOTAM said to land on the adjacent taxiway. From a pretty good distance away you could see trucks and things on the runway forming X&#039;s. There was another pilot landing #1 in front of me, in a nice plane (so I assumed he was fairly experienced). He came on the radio on short final and said, &quot;what&#039;s all that stuff on the runway?&quot; In return, the airport guy came on the radio and shouted &quot;Runway closed! Runway closed!&quot; I just couldn&#039;t believe this guy didn&#039;t do even the most basic of preparation for his flight! Short final is not the time to be discovering these things.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thx, Jason for your help!!!!!. Im study for my  checkride. I have only 7 hours but i need to study. Because there are lot of pilots that  learn regulations only for the text and forget everything in the moment that they need it. If you can make a vid about communication in differents airspaces.  Thax!!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[DJ,

I don;t know for sure but I&#039;d say yes. Things like this just don&#039;t &quot;magically&quot; leave your record. Any job or insurance quote is going to be hard to get. I think once you&#039;re on the list it makes a lot of things tough. Now I could be quite wrong. If so please someone step in and correct me.

		<description><![CDATA[Very good, and very correct. I have a service through the FAA where they email me all NOTAMS in my area so it is very unlikely for me to forget to check them. Could violating something like this make it difficult to get a position for an airline? I assume it would, but I didn&#039;t know if there is only a certain degree of violation that could compromise employment. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Gunner! Hope all is well with you man!

The book is as current as ever! Up to 2012 standards and beyond.

There are only around 100 regulations needed for private and sport pilots. So if ANY of them change i new version will come out. However the last big change was the FAA medicals 2 years ago. These regulations normally stay pretty constant.

		<description><![CDATA[Congrats on the 2nd solo X/C getting closer to the checkride it sounds like. :) Never worry about &quot;Over thinking&quot; when it comes to checking TFRs and NOTAMs Now I guess you don&#039;t need to know about every unlit tower in a 3,000 mile radius but you get the idea
