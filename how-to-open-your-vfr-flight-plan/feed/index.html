		<description><![CDATA[Be careful, one error of note in this video, per the AIM flight service stations are to be addressed as Facility Name followed by &quot;Radio&quot;.  So the maker of this video should have hailed &quot;Gainesville Radio&quot; not &quot;Gainesville Flight Service Station&quot;, you can hear the briefer tried to correct him, but he didn&#039;t seem to catch it.  While this is admittedly a minor error, it&#039;s one that I would expect a more experiences pilot not to make.  For that reason I would caution viewers of this guys videos to be careful about how much they trust his videos...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Always double up. I flew to Laughlin Nev. from San Diego this past Feb. and opened my flight plan with San Diego Radio on 122.2( flight plan was filed in DUATS). San Diego radio told me my flight plan was opened and requested weather reports along the way. I also opened VFR flight following with SOCAL and was passed to LA Center along the way. I was so busy with LA Center that I did not give any weather reports to San Diego/ Riverside radio. After landing in Laughlin I called to close out my flight plan,1-800-992-7433, After a long pause the tech on the phone came back and said&quot; I&#039;m sorry but some how your flight plan got lost after contact with you and wasn&#039;t opened, I don&#039;t know what to tell you!&quot; Be Safe double up, flight plan , flight following.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re right, the listen on one/transmit on the other frequency is nuts. I&#039;m building an RV-7A and I am not installing VOR radios since I have GPS. So there&#039;s no way to listen on a frequency that the plane isn&#039;t capable of receiving. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just did my long x-c and I was actually taught, why not open it on the ground right before calling up tower (if it&#039;s not busy) so you can focus completely on flying the plane, and talking to ATC. We also normally close on the ground on the taxi in to the hanger.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great Comment Brad!

haha I love the FAA&#039;s verbiage  &quot;This procedure should be avoided at busy airports. &quot;

I&#039;ve tried this even at some smaller class D airports and have had some controllers totally blow me off and have had others not only open my flight plan but also get me a squawk code for VFR flight following...

Now that&#039;s service

Just have to catch the controller in a good mood
