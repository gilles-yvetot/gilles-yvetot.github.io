		<description><![CDATA[Thanks a lot for giving information on 5 common student pilot errors. Taking
Flight career is a really good option for the apprentices who are really
interested. The flight academies that provide various aviation programs also
provide distance learning scholarships. These distance learning training
courses only include the theoretical knowledge of pilot tutoring education.

		<description><![CDATA[Clearing turns are vastly overrated. While clearing is a good idea, it doesn&#039;t help to do two 90 degree turns to clear. With an average speed of 120 knots, two aircraft close at 4 miles a minute, so someone out of visual range is in your face halfway through your maneuver. Add in the fact that you need to look above, below and at your altitude, and you really have just wasted your time, and probably won&#039;t see most of the traffic that might be of interest during your maneuver. Look where you are turning, before you turn, and during your turn (chandelle, lazy eight, etc.)  Clearing is a habit, keeping your SA up about what is around you is a habit. Clearing turns...another rote execise. 

Checklists. Less is more. A &quot;pre maneuver checklist&quot; ?  Wow. Memorize. Do. Then verify with the hard card. A checklist isn&#039;t a read and do list.

Crosswind turn. The AIM isn&#039;t a bad place to start. In singles, I tend to turn when I decide I&#039;m high enough to not go straight ahead in the event of an engine failure. About 500 feet, I turn and evaluate whether or not the airport is an option if the engine should sputter. Before that, I go straight ahead.Takes away the need for that decision in the heat of the moment.  Sometimes outside factors don&#039;t allow me to turn when I want, but  that is my template.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I own a Light sport Eurofox which is just slightly lighter than a 150. My issue seems to be on landings that if there is a crosswind of 8 knots or more that I get tossed around. It seems to me on your crosswind videos that you are quite stable with very little stick/yoke movement. Any suggestions to be smoother on the windy landings?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice video and explanation of crosswind landings, being a new sport pilot myself, I have become more and more confident by pushing myself to practice x-wind landings, and frequently ask my instructor to fly the pattern with me when winds are high, in one case it was a day in which we had 18 direct x-wind, crazy to say, but after 4 or 5 touch and goes, although challenging, really a lot of fun....definitely counter intuitive...just takes a bit of time to train the brain :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So true! I just completed my &quot;pre-solo stagecheck,&quot; which is required at my flight school (Panorama @KHPN). The checkride instructor (not my usual instructor) asked for some steep turns, and I went right into the first turn without clearing first. About 45 degrees around he &quot;confirmed&quot; that I was doing the first of two clearing turns. Of course I wasn&#039;t intending to, but I rolled out at 90 degrees and did another turn the other direction. He still passed me (I&#039;ll solo for the first time this weekend coming up), but it totally slipped my mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Second big agreement (I agree with all, but some especially so): Checklists! I wouldn&#039;t have forgotten the clearing turns if I used my pre-maneuver checklist.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Few words from Europe. Here the examiner is always PIC, based on the idea that he&#039;s the sole on board having a valid rating. Recurrent checks where the examinee is rated (annual IFR check, i.e.) are different.

Regarding the speeds, I fully agree with you. My take-off briefings always include rotation, Vx and Vy. Not just &quot;standard take-off&quot; but the actual values.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I actually want to also point out what I believe is an incorrect statement: &quot;proper cloud clearance which is: 1,000 feet above, 500 feet below, and 2000 feet horizontal from the clouds.&quot; As a general rule for most GA recreational pilots flying single-engine prop aircraft, this works. However, 14 CFR 91.155 states that this rule only applies to Class C; Class D; Class E below 10,000MSL; Class G below 1200ASL at night regardless of MSL; and Class G above 1200ASL but below 10,000MSL. All other airspace have different cloud clearances. One example where only remembering this rule is if a pilot regularly flies in Southern California coast area.]]></description>
