		<description><![CDATA[Jason, thanks for all of the free stuff that you put out there for educating﻿ folks 
to the proper methods of flying. One suggestion that I have for you concerning this video&#039;s subject matter is as follows. 

Wouldn&#039;t it be better if pilots used aircraft model &#038; color in their radio calls rather then tail # at uncontrolled airports? It is easier to see a white w/red stripe Cessna 150 then it is to look for tail # 512R. If you can read the tail # you are way to close. For lesser known aircraft models, a simple description such as high (or low) wing w/color description will do. That makes it easier to match radio calls and positions of aircraft with what you see out the window, and to realize you&#039;re dealing with a pilot who either isn&#039;t making calls, or doesn&#039;t have a radio. Suggestion from Rick  &quot;RAonUTUBE&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jason, thanks for the refresher!  We&#039;re losing our local ATC as well (KRYN, Tucson, AZ).  I hope everyone flying into this airport will communicate as professionally as the guys working the pattern in your video.  Turbines and NORDOs are going to be my concern.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was just thinking about how this is going to effect our general aviation pilots. I teach at a school with a student control tower- and the great majority of the pilots are students as well. With less jobs available for those tower students, how many of them will take on the flying world instead? 
Also...any idea where to find info on what tower are closing/closed? 
Another concern is those of us who don&#039;t like to buy updated charts...uh oh. They&#039;re going to be a lot different this time- but when?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jason, any thoughts on how this will affect work load and ability to get flight following? I like the added set of eyes and ability to get this on the ground at a tower controlled field, seems this may be an impact area to some extent and interested in your thoughts... Thanks for the awesome resource including the videos and thought provoking discussions. Ken]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Am I wrong in thinking that the biggest problems we&#039;ll be facing are the airspeed differentials at the larger airports where tower ops. have been discontinued. In some cases  parallel runways may help solve some of the problems but lest we forget the terms downwind, base and final mean different things to 737 driver than they do to a Cherokee pilot. Final for a 73 may be 10 miles in some cases and with a landing speed of 140K, they are in all cases that I can think of, significantly faster than the Cherokee. Be careful not to cut off the heavy iron because you think you have enough room to land and turn off before the faster jet starts gnawing at your trim tabs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Fellow Pilots:
Great brush-up for those who eschew non-towered airports.....but these is something that bothers me:  these are NOT &#039;uncontrolled&#039; airports, they are PILOT controlled airports.  We need to take responsibility for our traffic flow and use standard pattern entries with the appropriate position reports.  

Try to remember this phraseology of PILOT controlled airports especially when speaking to the non-flying public.  As soon as Joe of Jane Tarmac hears &#039;uncontrolled&#039; they think of terror in the skies...and we all know that is just not true....IF we all play by the rules.

Comments, anyone?]]></description>
