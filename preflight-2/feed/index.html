		<description><![CDATA[I teach my students the same three, but I don&#039;t physically check tire pressure, perhaps I will incorporate that into my teaching and personal flying.

Lesson learned: I had a great student, post solo, so to be nice and save time, I told him I would preflight the right side and he could do the left. I checked everthing on my side, he passed me the dip guage, then he got a phone call. I gave him the dip guage back and climbed in the right seat, he strapped in the left. I did the takeoff, just for my practice, I rotated when I felt lift on the wings, checked the airspeed indicator for &quot;needle alive&quot;, set the pitch for Yy,  retracted the flaps, checked the  airspeed, and it showed 50K, and was increasing very slowly. I told the student we would return for landing since the airspeed indicator was not indicating 76K as it should in a stablized climb and we probably impacted a bug with our pitot tube. The student had a &quot;sheepish&quot; look on his face and I asked what was wrong and he said, &quot;I think I forgot to remove the pitot cover&quot;. I looked around the pillar and sure enough, I could see the red flag flapping in the breeze.

Four good lessons learned: 1. if your checklist flow is interuptred, double check you did not miss anything 2. don&#039;t split the preflight 3. it drove home the point that if you set the correct pitch and power, and the airspeed is not as expected, then something is wrong 4. it proved what all pilots know, that if the pitot tube is blocked, but the drain port is open, the airspeed indicator works just like an altimeter: on climbs it increases and on descents it decreases, but is very inaccurate.

I always do a preflight, before my student arrives. Now, before strapping in, I do a walk around to check for the obvious...pitot cover removed, chocks removed, etc. I also, do not offer to split the preflight with the student anymore.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One thing I DON&#039;T do is FAKE IT! Seriously, I&#039;ve seen too many students run through the checklist and half hazardly check things because they &quot;have to&quot;. They have this desire to get through the pre-flight so they can get to the &quot;fun stuff&quot;. I personally not only take my time, but actually think about why I&#039;m doing each action and how important it is that I do it while on the ground (especially since I&#039;m not getting charged for the plane running!).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One thing I always do is physically look in the baggage compartment. It really defeats the purpose of doing a weight and balance if it is inaccurate. I must confess, this comes from a solo flight where I lugged a case and a half of oil (adding probably 35 pounds or more) back there without realizing it. I found it, when I was getting the tow bar.

		<description><![CDATA[Jason and Larry,

I count myself as having had a solid set of instructors during my training. We went through all of these, and then some. We used the typical pre-flight checklists, then added several &quot;good to be aware of&quot; items like these. As always, great information, followed by great comments from your fans!

Thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ I had a great flight instructor and he drilled into me the following preflight checklist:

- check for any cuts in the tires / inflation

- check for any oil blowout from the exhaust

- check for any leaking brake fluid

- check stall indicator and pitot tube for loose debris

- drain any water from fuel tanks

- check fuel gauges after dip-sticking tanks

- # of flight hours (how close to manditory inspection / annual)

- check that the aircraft registration, certificates and any other
  paperwork are up to date

-  check that the &quot;JESUS&quot; pin is in place (horizontal stabalizer)

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jason,
 
Thanks for the info. I have never checked the tyre pressures on the club Warriors I fly, we all presume that they are ok. Maybe we should ask for a guage to check them.
I personally always do a visual on the fuel contents, along with stall warner check (this is an easily forgotten item) and hinges check on the aleirons and stabilator.
Also most people forget the two push buttons inside the warrior that clear out the pitot tube.

		<description><![CDATA[I always check the quantities of the fuel, and I look at the aileron: hinges cotter pins and connecting rods. but I have never checked the tire pressure before. I think I&#039;ll recommend it to my CFI and see if we can add it to our pre-flight! ( also when I drop the flaps down, I glance at the aileron control cables to see it maybe they&#039;ve rusted or frayed.)

		<description><![CDATA[Although I do not check tire pressures every time (moderately regularly, but honestly not as often as I should!), there are a number of other things I do; 

As I walk alongside the fuselage of our 150 I run my hand along the lower portion, if any damage has occurred one should feel any wrinkles.

In common with many others I check the cotter pins in the aileron hinges as well as the link and also that both ailerons move correctly.

I always check fuel first and then, when I am at the tail I eyeball the fuel caps to make sure they are aligned and correctly seated.]]></description>

I&#039;ve followed you for a while now and believe that we have the same intentions. i.e. pass pilot check rides and be safe pilots. I&#039;d like to promote your products: however, I don&#039;t promote anything without first reviewing them. My site is http:/www.aviationmd.com. Although, your a competitor, I thought it would be best to contact you first. Maybe we could work together?

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Everybody. Two weeks ago the trainer C150 was inspected. During the inspection, the horizontal stabalizer was gently checked for secureness. It is segested to check this from about a foot out from the fuselage. There was no movment or play. How ever when checked from out at the end of the stabalizer
there was enough play found to take the plane out of service to have it replaced.
Also there were no signs of staining from rivits present. Just food for thought.
If a wing or other part of the impenage is checked this way it should be gental as not to cause problems.]]></description>
