		<description><![CDATA[Â Please accept my apologies Jason, If you had made it clear what your intentions were regarding the profits and a kids aviation camp, I would not have felt the need to make any comment other than to say I would have wholeheartedly supported the webinar, if i can still make the $25 donation and download a recording I am more than happy to do so. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mike, I agree it&#039;s a choice, but you don&#039;t need to call anyone an &quot;idiot&quot;. Â Aviation is expensive, and $25 is not insignificant to everyone. Â He definitely could have charged less. Â So yeah it&#039;s true, if you don&#039;t want to pay then just don&#039;t sign up, but I also agree that he charges a lot for his services, between $60 for a checkride prep book to $100+ a month for his ground school. Â It&#039;s a business, but we can be reasonable about it. Â Call me an idiot if you must.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jason,

While I want to attend your webinar, my financial resources are dedicated elsewhere at the current time. Â Will your webinar recording be available for purchase at a later time? Â I wouldÂ definitely love to purchase the recording when I get closer to my checkride. Â Thanks in advance.Â

		<description><![CDATA[Disregard the idiots who are complaining about the 25 fee. They obviously don&#039;t have a concept of what it is to sacrafice for aviation. 25 is nothing compared to what it can do for you. And of course what the money can do for our youth in aviation. See you at the webinar. Mike R]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Alland,

One thing loyal MzeroA fans know is that my heart goes into everything I do. I think of you guys and gals above all else.

As i&#039;ve explained to a few others via email. After I pay my 30% in taxes :) what&#039;s left over is going to an aviation camp for kids to get their private pilot certificate.

This is a business my friend and a very blessed on at that. The reason we&#039;re so blessed is because we continue to enrich others and give back to this wonderful community.

Jason

		<description><![CDATA[I have followed your advice for quite a few months Jason, and yes you are a professional so need to makeÂ  living, but I am disappointed you are hitting on folk for $25.00 a head to get to hear a sample of what we will expect to find on our checkride.
I would not object to a reasonable donation, but $25.00 ! Sorry Jason it would appear you have now entered into a different agenda from the one you had when you first started MzeroA Â  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If this is not for making $ 25,000 , what is?
Â I already emailed you my comment about you becoming a businessman rather than a pilot. 
In order to make sure that people show up to this, charge, and then refund those who did show up, and keep the money for those who didn&#039;t. 
IÂ don&#039;t like this attitude: you&#039;re underscoring our inteligence, and I&#039;m sure other people think the same.
Respectfully.
