		<description><![CDATA[While I do agree that this &quot;article&quot; is difficult to understand, keep in mind that this isn&#039;t an article per se. Rather, it&#039;s the text transcript of Jason&#039;s episode on Flight Training Radio. Listening to the episode might help you with understanding what he was saying. But like you said, I would encourage Jason to do a little proof-reading before posting the text portion. Great info nonetheless!

		<description><![CDATA[It is in my opinion that flying with any digital aid is a awesome thing. We have it these days to use at out disposal, however Digital technology can fail on a moments notice. It is easier to remember what we have all learned with our training. Using our charts, plotters, and slide calculators. Not to mention I think its fun to see how accurate you can be. If we forget how to use what we are taught then it might just bite you when that electronic device fails. How embarrassing would that be to explain to an inspector? how bad would that make the general aviation population look as far as mishaps goes. There really is no excuse to be a dummy when you are on or off the ground with nothing but
air space below you. Retain what you took so much time to study.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not trying to be over critical, but I would kindly suggest that you get a grammar program for  your computer and maybe it would help you write where people can understand better. Or, maybe you could find someone to proof read your articles for you.  I had a terrible time reading this article and understanding just what you were saying. Although I took flying lessons years ago, I am now just a fsx pilot, but have enjoyed your videos and they have been very helpful to me. I try to make it as real as possible when I fly fsx. I hope you take this in the right way.

Thanks
