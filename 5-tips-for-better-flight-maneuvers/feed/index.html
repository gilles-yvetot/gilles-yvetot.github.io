I also list the price, date, weather and what i saw through the windows.&lt;br&gt;Sometimes i explain some formula or technical term in my own language. Just to make it more &#039;my own&#039;.&lt;br&gt;A sideeffect is that my friends are now also reading it, and started asking supplementary questions like: &quot;When are you flying again? When can you take me with you? How high are you allowed to fly?&quot; and so on. Then we talk about flying, and i get a chance to once again explain everything about altimetersettings or whatever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So when i make other people interested in what i do, they help me getting better at it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I hope this tip will help you getting there!&lt;br&gt;Clear skies!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Br&lt;br&gt;Peter]]></description>

<p>I am studying for an ultralight license, and to help me remembering all the things i learn, i am writing a blog / diary about the project of getting me airborne.<br />Every flying lesson is described by which procedures we did, and my own opinion about how well i performed. I also list the price, date, weather and what i saw through the windows.<br />Sometimes i explain some formula or technical term in my own language. Just to make it more &#39;my own&#39;.<br />A sideeffect is that my friends are now also reading it, and started asking supplementary questions like: &#8220;When are you flying again? When can you take me with you? How high are you allowed to fly?&#8221; and so on. Then we talk about flying, and i get a chance to once again explain everything about altimetersettings or whatever.</p>
<p>So when i make other people interested in what i do, they help me getting better at it.</p>
<p>I hope this tip will help you getting there!<br />Clear skies!</p>
