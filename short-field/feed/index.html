		<description><![CDATA[What airspeed was used and how much power? Whats this progressive flap stuff? Ever heard of the 3 second rule?{ actually I made it up. Any thing more than a 3 second float after power off and your airspeed was too high. 150 is one of the short field champions. I have the original Texas Tail dragger 150/150 STOL and it will consistantly get down and stopped in 480 ft with no obstacles with a play it safe 3 second float. 40 ias full flap approach. Off in the same distance. Stock 150 i find will land just about as short but a lot longer on take off. Been instructing for forty years and still enjoy your articles. Keep em comming.
