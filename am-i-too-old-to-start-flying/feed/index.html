		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jason,

Ah, thank you for covering this topic as I am in a similar situation as the 48 year old.

My thoughts were along the same lines, go for it and see how far I can get.

Another avenue for a pilots job may be with regional airlines.  Here in Australia the local regional airlines are always complaining that the larger domestic guys are always poaching their pilots.  Well, perhaps they would be happy with an older pilot who is more likely to stay with them for a longer tenure, particularly if you offered to do that.

And who knows, in 17 years when eligible to retire the minimum age may have been pushed up again.

Looking forward to the next video.
