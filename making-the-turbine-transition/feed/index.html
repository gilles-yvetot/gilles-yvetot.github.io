		<description><![CDATA[Â Hey Jason!

I was originally taught to fly angle of attack on approach Â in anticipation that I would go to the airlines and fly jets. This was not my request, but how they taught me. Problem is, you really should not fly angle of attack in a piston, which I am flying. I recently got some additional training as I prepare for the instrument check ride, and this was the first thing my instructor wanted to undo. He has 15,000 hours with the airlines, and he said I need to fly how the airplane I am in needs to fly, not like some jet I might fly in the future. It took a couple hours before I could see the difference since it was so ingrained in me. He does own an L-39, so I might get a chance in the future to fly a jet :-) but for the mean time, I will focus on the 172 at hand. The real lesson- treat them all differently, because they are all very different. Don&#039;t just learn to fly, learn to fly that specific airplane, and don&#039;t expect other airplanes the handle the same.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When I made the transition the most difficult obstacle was definitely the complexity of the aircraft systems. Most ppasel guys have not been stressed the importance of knowing their airplanes systems like they should. If you start taking an interest early on with simple airplanes the transition will be much easier. Another hurdle to overcome was memorizing all of the emergency items, speeds and starting procedures (and abort starting procedures).

My transition was 4 years ago, 800 hours TT, Cessna T210 to a King Air 350 PIC Type Rating.]]></description>
