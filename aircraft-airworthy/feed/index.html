		<description><![CDATA[Hi Paul!

Awesome addition to the post! As an instructor it&#039;s important to sit down with students and show them the logs. This can be difficult because I know as an aircraft owner I keep the logs locked up at home. (for safety reasons)

But I do bring them out of hiding every now and then to show students
