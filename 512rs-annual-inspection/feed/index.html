		<description><![CDATA[Well here is a item, say on a Navajo the O2 bottle is due for hydrostatic testing.This would be under special inspections,along with many other items..like flap motors etc. but hopefully coincides with the 100 hr or Annual.This would not be done every 100 hrs...or even every Annual.But as far as the customer is concerned it means more time and expense, and making it a different from the year before.On more complex aircraft the 100hr/Annual inspections are never the same twice.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am not an A&#038;P however, I was heavily involved in a flying club with 15 airplanes. My mentor was not only the owner, but the A &#038; P and AI as well. Our annuals were much more intensive than 100 hour inspections whether our club planes or other individuals. All inspection covers were opened and ALL control points including bell cranks, pulleys and cable were checked as well as everything that could be seen. You don&#039;t pull all the covers on your airframe at 100 hour intervals. A 100 hour inspection mostly covers the engine and brakes.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello! I have a few questions to be answered here! Any and all input is much appreciated... So here it goes.
I am currently a Canadian licensed AME with M1 and M2 category ratings, Im looking into getting my A&#038;P conversion and am lost as to which direction I need to start looking. I realize there is a few tests as well as an Oral and Practical portion as well, but how/where do I go about doing the practical? 
 Secondly what is the limitations to the A&#038;P license? Can I sign off an annual on a Privately owned JetRanger the same as I do in Canada? Also I am currently type rated on Bell 206 and Bell 205/204 can these also be converted over as well? Thank you for your input!
