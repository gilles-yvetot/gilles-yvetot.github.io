		<description><![CDATA[I never did turning stalls and I am dissapointed I didn&#039;t do them in my training or the check ride, but I am 123 hours in and going to be obtaining Â an Instrument rating in a month or so, then I will be working on my commercial certification over the summer. Will I be going through these stalls in commercial training in 141 school?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very cool, I am about ready to solo and watching your video.I like the different perspective I get from the video.I have been struggling with crosswind landings and your comment about coming in a little faster was a BIG HELP.I would recommend any student pilot to watch your videos.I am watching them right now and am going flying in about an hour ready to
Do some power on turning stalls and put some more of your advice to use.Thanks

		<description><![CDATA[This is excellent! Â  Great job! Â With my students I know that turning stalls (p/on) really DO press their buttons. Â Enjoyed the &#039;hands-off&#039; demonstration, certainly could further instill into a student the relative stability of the aircraft as it relates to stalls and spins. Â Good work!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Turning stall recovery is essentially the same as recovering from a stall straight ahead. They can develop into a spin but its very unlikely.Â  If you understand what causes a stall and how to recover from one I don&#039;t understand the high emphasis... IMO some instructors overemphasis somethings (Like stalls) and put too little emphasis on things that are much more likely to kill you.Â  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mr. Jason

I&#039;m a student pilot from Indonesia, thank you very much for all your sharing about flying, it teaches me a lot. But i want to suggest that, because most of Indonesian people don&#039;t understand English very well, so can you add an English subtitle on all of your videos. Because sometimes i cannot understand or hear what word you said. I mean if there is a subtitle about everything you said, it would be much easier for me to check the word on Â a dictionary.

Just like this video of turning stalls, because your voice is disturbed by the engine sound, so i cannot understand at first time. Then i have to repeat again-again just to make sure that I&#039;m not getting the wrong conclusion.

Thanks a lot.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve done falling leaf, also known as deep stalls, in both an Aeronca Champ and a C152. There is a big difference, in the Champ, you&#039;re literally behaving like a falling leaf, and doing a tap dance to keep from dropping into a spin. In the C152, the plane acts more like a big parachute, just mushes mostly straight down and mine wants to dip off to the left so you just hold some right rudder to keep it level. Funny, as much as I dislike stalls, I enjoy this maneuver and always feel much better about my skills after doing it. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t do turning stalls either, but in the middle of my check ride, after he saw my stalls, Â my DPE had me just hold the yoke back and ride the stall while keeping the wings level with the pedals. It wasn&#039;t part of the test, it was part of him making me a better pilot.Â 

If my poor description has enticed anyone, look up falling leaf maneuver. A video from APS is on Youtube: http://youtu.be/ZOPsQn2MksgA note: there&#039;s a lot less wallowing in a 172 compared to the Extra 300.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My first comment here, Jason.Â  Great video, by the way.Â  Firstly, I&#039;ve just done my PPL checkride here in Canada, and turning stalls aren&#039;t on the syllabus.Â  Secondly I wonder, are all airplanes as benign as your demonstrator?Â  Would they all recover from a stall, turning stall and spin themselves &quot;hands-off&quot;?Â  I have heard that the plane I trained in, a Piper Warrior will do so, but will all types?Â  If not you might want to mention it before a viewer tries it on a more twitchy model based on your video.
Cheers]]></description>
