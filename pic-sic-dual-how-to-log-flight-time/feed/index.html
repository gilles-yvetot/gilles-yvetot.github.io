		<description><![CDATA[There is a &quot;legal interpretation&quot; from the FAA on a topic you have discussed above.  The question is can a ASEL private pilot without a complex endorsement act as PIC of a complex aircraft.  

The FAA has determined that due to the ambiguity of the regulations, which require the pilot to only be appropriately rated, that it IS ok for that pilot to log PIC time as a safety pilot.

		<description><![CDATA[&#039;&#039;Acting as PIC – Regulations require that one person on board is always acting as PIC.

This person is legally responsible for the safe operation of that aircraft. However
regulations also allow for one additional person to log PIC as long as that person
generates an experience of sufficient value.&#039;&#039;
Jason, awesome article. That part I quoted from your writing describes my situation to perfection. Where can I find that regulation? &#039;&#039;As long as the person generates an experience of sufficient value&#039;&#039;. Can that be applied in ASEL if sharing time with someone that is not proficient in a new airplane in which this person has never built experience?

Thanks for your dedication.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Log whatever you want young bucks and aspiring aviators but if you&#039;re logging SIC in a C-172 you&#039;re going to look like an idiot if and when you get a real pilot interview. If you&#039;re extremely low time and creatively logged flight time is the only thing that will get you across the finish line of an employer&#039;s bare minimums, then it may be worth a shot, but unless they are desperate or you are connected, the company will probably go with another pilot who has more solid flight time and probably looks more honest than you thanks to your logbook.

JAA rules utilize extra flight time categories like &quot;Pilot Under Training&quot; and &quot;Pilot in Command Under Supervision&quot; which makes command time a little easier to sort out in ambiguous situations.  Having to choose between PIC and SIC will always lead to some problems in situations like the ones discussed here.  My advice is to always log your flight time as the more conservative choice in instances where the FAR&#039;s could be debated. If you are hoping to be an airline pilot one day you don&#039;t want to engage in a pedantic debate where you are forced to defend your tortured logic and dubious flight time with a person who can make or break your career.  If it can be questioned then why give someone the chance? Creatively logged flight time is bad for your career so why bother?

		<description><![CDATA[Really I enjoyed this post on
flight time. My dream is also to become pilot and I know it is very responsible
job as safety of passengers is totally depends on that airplane pilots, so I want
to choose best flight training academy as there are lots of flight schools available
and finding best flight school for training is not easy but important task for
each people who want to become a good pilot. Nice post .

<p>Senario &#8211; </p>
<p>I have a Private Pilot single engine land endorsment, can I log the training time I have in a multi-engine aircraft as I am sole manipulator?  (but not rated yet&#8230;  and i have not solo-ed in one)</p>
<p>Please email me a response.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[i still dont agree...both pilots technically can log PIC, just like how a CFI logs PIC even though his student would be the &quot;sole manipulatier of the flight controls&quot;...also a safety pilot does NOT have to have his high performance or complex sign-off in order to be a saftey pilot, he only has 2 have &quot;at least a private pilot cert. with category and class ratings appropriate to the aircraft being flown.&quot; FAR 91.109 last time i check neither of these sign-offs fall under either of these

aw well in 91.109, nowhere in there does it say you can log SIC, like i said before techinically they are also PIC because they are responsible for &quot;see and avoid&quot; responsibility of other aircraft...therefore they can both log PIC, now as a &quot;safety pilot&quot; i prob wouldnt log that but since im a cfi i dont have to worry about that

as i said in earlier comments...the only time a person may log SIC is a)when a TYPE rating is required b)an aircraft over 12,500 lbs, c)any turbo-jet aircraft, and d)any aircraft the FAA deems worthy of requiring a SIC... last time i checked a saftey pilot doesnt fall under any of these...technically yes in order for Pilot A to be under the foggles another person has to be aboard but that other person does not meet any of this criteria for SIC

now in your scenario above i dont think Pilot B would be able to act as either PIC or SIC of any airplane because he is not current, due to him not having his flight review accomplished...none of those factors would have any effect on if they log either PIC or SIC, u dont have to be instrumented rated to act as a safety pilot, you dont need to be endorsed to fly high-performance airplanes, and your not current to fly any airplane because your not current yourself

let me put in an example...im a cfi(not a CFII)...if a pilot of a high-performance aircraft asks me to act as a saftey pilot of his aircraft so he can get instrument current, i can log it as PIC. that is because even though i dont have a hign-performance endorsement myself i am still acting as his safety pilot which means i can log the PIC]]></description>
