<p><strong>Pilot 1</strong> &#8211; “So since I was in the left seat, all that time I must have been pilot in<br />
command.” </p>
<p><strong>Pilot 2</strong> &#8211; “But I’m a CFI!” </p>
<p><strong>Pilot 1</strong> &#8211; “You didn’t teach me anything, you can’t log that as dual or PIC.” </p>
<p><strong>Pilot 2</strong> &#8211; “You wanna bet!?!?” </p>

<p>The only thing I can bet on is that you’ve either had, heard, or are going to have an<br />
argument like the one above sometime in your flying career. Don’t you want to be the<br />
one who’s on the right end of the argument? Let’s take a closer look on what exactly is<br />
a PIC and how do you log it properly. </p>
<p>They’re three situations in which a pilot may log pilot in command time (PIC) </p>
<p>-You are the sole manipulator of the controls and operating an aircraft in which you are<br />
rated. </p>
<p> Example: You are flying a Cessna 172 and currently hold an airplane<br />
single engine land rating. </p>
<p>-You are the sole occupant in the aircraft </p>
<p> Example: You are properly rated and flying the aircraft solo. NOTE: Split personalities do not count as other occupants!!! </p>
<p>Now for the tough one. </p>
<p>-You are acting as pilot in command of an aircraft by which more than one pilot is<br />
required under that aircrafts type certification or the regulations by which the flight is<br />
conducted. </p>
<p>This one is a bit tough, in order to fully grasp this idea we must first understand the<br />
difference between logging PIC and acting as PIC. </p>
<p>Acting as PIC &#8211; Regulations require that one person on board is always acting as PIC.<br />
This person is legally responsible for the safe operation of that aircraft. However<br />
regulations also allow for one additional person to log PIC as long as that person<br />
generates an experience of sufficient value. </p>
<p>Example: You and a friend both have your <a href="../home/private-pilot/index.html">private pilot</a> licenses and<br />
airplane single engine land ratings. You rent and Cessna 172 and take off for the sky.<br />
Your friend decides to brush up on his instrument flying and puts on a view limiting<br />
device. You act as his safety pilot, while he is the sole manipulator of the controls. Who<br />
gets to log the PIC?</p>
<p>There are two answers to this question. Who did you elect to be the legal acting PIC? If<br />
your friend said he’ll be the legal PIC or the acting PIC, he not only assumes all legal<br />
responsibility, he is the only one who can log PIC. While you as a safety pilot can only<br />
log SIC. Second and command in a 172, pretty good title huh? </p>
<p>The second more common scenario is while your friend is “under the hood” you act not<br />
only as safety pilot, but also as PIC. Now you are responsible for the safety of the flight,<br />
yet your friend is still the sole manipulator of the controls. This time both the safety pilot<br />
acting as PIC and the pilot flying can log PIC. </p>
<p>Continuing with the safety pilot theme there is one other area that students ask me<br />
about. “What if I act as a safety pilot for my friend in a Piper Arrow? I don’t have my<br />
complex endorsement.” Although you do not have your complex endorsement your<br />
friend is still required to have a safety pilot, and you are rating as single engine land. In<br />
this situation you cannot log PIC but you can log it as SIC.<br />
Now for the real heartbreaker, what if my friend and I go flying, both with single engine<br />
land ratings and no one wears a view limiting device. Is there any situation that we<br />
could both log PIC? </p>
<p><a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/downloads/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/5628.jpg');"  href="../wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/5628.jpg"><img src="../wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/5628-205x300.jpg" alt="" title="5628" width="205" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-231" /></a></p>
<p>Unfortunately that is not possible, I’ve heard all the arguments from both sides of the<br />
fence but the regulations 61.51(e) states all that we’ve said above.<br />
What about logging time for instructors?<br />
61.51(e)(3) states an instructor may log flight time as PIC when that individual is<br />
instructing. </p>
<p>What about training for my complex or high performance endorsement?<br />
Remember, this goes back to our acting or logging as PIC. As long as you are training,<br />
with an authorized instructor who has said endorsement you are pursuing you can log<br />
that time as PIC since your instructor is acting as PIC. Again this can be found in 61.51<br />
I hope this clears up any misconceptions around the airport. Remember through<br />
education and knowledge you can become a safer pilot.</p>

<p>Take a look at this straight off Rod Machado&#8217;s website:</p>
<p> That person who is serving as a safety pilot may choose to act as the legal pilot-in-command (per 14 CFR part 1) and log the time as PIC  [per §61.51(e)(1)(iii)], or otherwise log the time as SIC time [per §61.51(f)(2)], but is not even required to log the time at all.  However, the safety pilot&#8217;s name must be logged by the person practicing instrument flight [per §61.51(g)(3)(ii)].   If the safety pilot is going to act as the legal PIC for the flight that person must “. . . Hold the appropriate category, class, and type rating (if a class rating and type rating are required) for the aircraft to be flown;” [per §61.31(d)(1)]. ).   And if the flight is conducted in a high performance, complex, tail wheel, etc. aircraft and the safety pilot is acting as the legal PIC that pilot must have the appropriate endorsements that are required by §61.31(e), (f) and/or (i), as appropriate.  This could be a reason why a safety pilot might only be able to serve as an SIC and log it as SIC time.</p>
<p>Hope this clear it up.</p>

<p>Pilot A wishes to fly with Pilot B for the purpose of practicing instrument flying in a high-performance aircraft. Pilot A may legally act as PIC and has agreed to act as PIC. Pilot A will be wearing a view-limiting device and will be flying by reference to instruments. Pilot B is rated in the aircraft and has a current medical certificate but is not instrument rated, endorsed to fly high-performance airplanes, or have a current flight review. Pilot B has agreed to be the safety pilot for the flight.</p>
<p>Pilot A may log PIC and simulated instrument time. Pilot B may log second-in-command (SIC) time. Pilot A is assuming PIC responsibilities and may log PIC. Pilot B is a crewmember where more than one pilot is required and may log SIC (FAR 61.51). Again, because Pilot B is a required crewmember, he/she will need a current medical certificate (FAR 61.3).</p>
<p>Why is Pilot B a required crew member? Because you must always have a safety pilot under simulated instrument conditions. (FAR 91.109)</p>

<p>aw well in 91.109, nowhere in there does it say you can log SIC, like i said before techinically they are also PIC because they are responsible for &#8220;see and avoid&#8221; responsibility of other aircraft&#8230;therefore they can both log PIC, now as a &#8220;safety pilot&#8221; i prob wouldnt log that but since im a cfi i dont have to worry about that</p>
<p>as i said in earlier comments&#8230;the only time a person may log SIC is a)when a TYPE rating is required b)an aircraft over 12,500 lbs, c)any turbo-jet aircraft, and d)any aircraft the FAA deems worthy of requiring a SIC&#8230; last time i checked a saftey pilot doesnt fall under any of these&#8230;technically yes in order for Pilot A to be under the foggles another person has to be aboard but that other person does not meet any of this criteria for SIC</p>
<p>now in your scenario above i dont think Pilot B would be able to act as either PIC or SIC of any airplane because he is not current, due to him not having his flight review accomplished&#8230;none of those factors would have any effect on if they log either PIC or SIC, u dont have to be instrumented rated to act as a safety pilot, you dont need to be endorsed to fly high-performance airplanes, and your not current to fly any airplane because your not current yourself</p>
<p>let me put in an example&#8230;im a cfi(not a CFII)&#8230;if a pilot of a high-performance aircraft asks me to act as a saftey pilot of his aircraft so he can get instrument current, i can log it as PIC. that is because even though i dont have a hign-performance endorsement myself i am still acting as his safety pilot which means i can log the PIC</p>

<p>JAA rules utilize extra flight time categories like &#8220;Pilot Under Training&#8221; and &#8220;Pilot in Command Under Supervision&#8221; which makes command time a little easier to sort out in ambiguous situations.  Having to choose between PIC and SIC will always lead to some problems in situations like the ones discussed here.  My advice is to always log your flight time as the more conservative choice in instances where the FAR&#8217;s could be debated. If you are hoping to be an airline pilot one day you don&#8217;t want to engage in a pedantic debate where you are forced to defend your tortured logic and dubious flight time with a person who can make or break your career.  If it can be questioned then why give someone the chance? Creatively logged flight time is bad for your career so why bother?</p>

Jason, awesome article. That part I quoted from your writing describes my situation to perfection. Where can I find that regulation? &#8221;As long as the person generates an experience of sufficient value&#8221;. Can that be applied in ASEL if sharing time with someone that is not proficient in a new airplane in which this person has never built experience?</p>
