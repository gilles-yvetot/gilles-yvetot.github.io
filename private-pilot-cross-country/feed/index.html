		<description><![CDATA[I took my first solo cross country about a month ago.  It was delayed a few times due to weather.  The morning I was to finally go the weather reports said it was a no go, and the briefer said it was not recommended.  However when I looked at the sky and the radar I could see no reason why I could not go.  I checked the ATIS at my departure and vis was only reporting 4 mile vis and the destination was at 2.  I talked it over with my instructor and he agreed with me.  We could see the mountain that was over 8 miles away as clear as could be.  So he told me to GO ahead and if when I get up there for any reason I could see an issue I was to return.  I went and got to the 12 mile mark from my destination and listened to the weather.  It was reporting marginal VFR.  I decided to get at least to the 6 mile mark before turning back.  I only made it to the 10 mile mark and could see the airport threw light haze.  So I decided to go anyway.  I made it there just fine and then back.  After it was all over I can honestly say that was one of the best flights I have ever had.  It was  only blowing 12 at 035 MSl and no turbulence at all on both legs.  So I did learn one thing.  The weather prediction is not always even close to being accurate.    But I will say if it was not familiar airspace I would have never done it in the first place…. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jason, Love your videos and website. I was due to do my first solo cross country last weekend but the crosswinds were too strong for me to go :( 
I have to wait another week now so hopefully the weather will be kind.
I fly from Jersey in the UK over to France and back. It&#039;s a great route lots of good landmarks.

Be safe
Paul ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am planning for my first cross country now. Dual, but the CFI wants me to do my best at getting it planned out. I have been using lakes, lookout towers, towns, railroad lines etc... It&#039;s seems straight fwd enough, and that is what makes me think it&#039;s not. I&#039;m missing something :)]]></description>
