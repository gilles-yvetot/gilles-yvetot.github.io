		<description><![CDATA[My dream has always been to go to Oklahoma to do their hyperbaric chamber. Now I can come and see you and go to Melbourne. I have felt the effects of hypoxia flying out of Salt Lake City II in a turbo Cessna 182. As we were getting close to Park City  I asked the instructor if we could do some steep turns and then I became happy and sloppy. As soon as I got on the Oxygen the symptoms went away. I will send you a picture also. I have flown with a smoker and during a night flight at 5000 ft he got tingly and numb and started slurring his words. We descending I took over the aircraft and the symptoms went away. I see hypoxia all the time in the hospital but that is at 800ft MSL. As soon as the O2 starts flowing at 6L patients do better too. Love you Man you are the greatest. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What are you talking about Matt?? hahaha were we watching the same video :) haha

The next day I slept until 10am and I&#039;m normally a up by 5am kind of guy! I was sooooo pooped.

I think people who are of various fitness levels experience hypoxia at different times. For example someone with 50 extra pounds over normal might experience hypoxia a bit sooner than someone more fit

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Mike!

The main take away from this and your comment is this...Hypoxia can strike at altitudes even lower then you would think!

Thanks for the comment man and keep up the GREAT work

		<description><![CDATA[Dear Jason many years ago I was flying with a non pilot passanger at night 26,000 ft IFR from Kansas to Brownsville TX my T21oJ has oxigen masks and I was as I like it flying myself no autopilot next scene my airpline diving at 10,000 ft I awoke, not any pre hypoxia I can remember just passed out, my mask stop providing oxygen  y leveled, reduced speed and took my scared passanger mask for me, requested a change altitude to 10,000 ft and kept the flight to Brownsville TX 
It´s something you should take good care and use a  good oxigen system.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have experienced mild hypoxia a few times. Twice in the Rocky Mountains and once in the air (flying to Oshkosh at just 10,000 feet). 

All three times I started feeling really good (a little too good) and found that I forgot things easily (answering radio calls etc). On the Oshkosh trip I wasn&#039;t the flying pilot but I was tasked with answering the radio. Let&#039;s just say, I didn&#039;t do very well after an hour at 10k. :-) 

I have since lost over 60 pounds and much improved my cardiovascular conditioning (by running etc). Now I am comfortable at 10k for extended periods of time with only minor symptoms (tingling hands) if any. 

I also noticed one of my flying buddies getting very irritated during a long night flight at 8000 feet. I was the flying pilot when out of nowhere he started getting grumpy, this was totally out of charter for him. I mentioned that he may be getting a little hypoxic and he only mumbled something. Later on he told me that he thought that he was hypoxic but didn&#039;t know it at the time. For me, I video tape my flights so I have an impartial witness to everything I do. 

Great demonstration, I only wish he had given you a bit more time to display the effects. 

I have been told that when you are very hypox you will perform like you are drunk but think you are doing a great job. 

Would have been funny: &quot;Dr Buza: Jason, you are in a steep dive!&quot; &quot;Jason: What are you talking about? I am doing great!&quot; :-)

It is scary how Hypoxia can slowly creep up on you. 
Thanks again for the lesson. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have never seen someone who&#039;s about to become hypoxic be so happy and excited!!

This was a really interesting video. Two things I noticed that I thought were really interesting and weren&#039;t mentioned -- your use of vocal disfluencies increases with altitude and your rate of speech slows. Basically you seem like a sleepy, slightly drunk person!

How did you feel afterwards? Were there any after-effects or symptoms that you experienced after you&#039;d come back to sea level?

There is something else I&#039;m curious about -- do people who are more aerobically fit tolerate a depressurization better?

This really is one of the best videos you&#039;ve made and incredibly instructive.
Cheers!]]></description>
