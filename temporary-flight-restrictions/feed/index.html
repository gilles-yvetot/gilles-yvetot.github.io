		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for that feedback. I eventually got the information I needed, he just wasn&#039;t very nice. This was only my 3rd or so call to them so I didn&#039;t know off the top of my head what info he would want. I started out the call by identifying myself as a student pilot. Is there possibly a way to leave feedback about your experience with a particular briefer? ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Two options: a) Ask them (in a pleasant voice) to repeat again and again until you receive the answers you wanted (they cannot hang up on you, and will have to answer as to why the call took soo long). b) Hang up and call again till you get someone who will work with you.

		<description><![CDATA[Hi all, 
Here&#039;s a good online source:
https://pilotweb.nas.faa.gov/PilotWeb/

Good idea about being &quot;on record&quot; by obtaining an official briefing (800-WX-BRIEF). But not sure it&#039;s going to help you much if you bust a TFR! But who knows. 
BTW, is it safe to walk backwards on the ramp? :-)

		<description><![CDATA[Both AOPA and the FAA send me email notices a few days ahead of VIP TFR&#039;s in my area and about a 200 mi. radius. VIP TFR&#039;s are common as I live in a so-called &#039;battleground&#039; state getting lots visits and bus tours from both Obama&#039;s &#038; Biden. 
If I&#039;m flying out of my area I always get a formal weather briefing including TFR&#039;s. 
It&#039;s important to note there are TFR&#039;s for other than VIP (president/VP) such as air shows, fires, etc. and it&#039;s important to know about those as well even though it&#039;s unlikely F-16&#039;s will greet you on those.]]></description>
