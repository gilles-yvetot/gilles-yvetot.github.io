		<description><![CDATA[Great job Steve. This is something I teach my students, use the VASI and PAPI to confirm the usual 3 degree glide slope. A little known fact is the VASI&#039;s and PAPI&#039;s (not MAMI&#039;s) are usually set up for multi-engine aircraft where the pilot sits higher. In a single engine aircraft, I follow white over white or pink over white all the way down with the proper approach speed for the conditions. The VASI will take you to the 1000 foot marker, which should have you touch down in the first third of the runway. Hold that VASI all the way and do not let it go all red. Bottom line: steeper approach wins out of low approach every time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cockpit video is a fantastic tool and helped me a lot in my training.  I think it is worth mentioning however that your focus should always be on flying the airplane.  If you&#039;re thinking about that camera while flying you are distracted and risk missing something key.  Your &quot;Secret To Perfect Landings&quot; book is a great refresher for pilots many hours past the Private Pilot practical.]]></description>
