		<description><![CDATA[I just did my first solo this morning. What a rush. My flight instructor wanted to see three landings and a go around before he asked me to do a full stop and drop him off on the taxiway. Then he said.. &quot;Go do your solo&quot;.  I wasn&#039;t expecting it and glad I had an extra shirt in my flight bag. It felt like total freedom to pilot that plane (though I talked myself through every leg of the pattern).  We did the traditional cutting of the shirt tail (luckily it wasn&#039;t my favorite) and the taking of pictures. I walked away a different person, remembering my first flight and wondering what all those knobs did. Good luck to those still awaiting this event. It is certainly worth it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just finished my first solo this morning. Funny - I was calm in the air and my landings all went well, but I was nervous on the ground taxing around until I got cleared for takeoff and back on the runway! I&#039;ve always heard about the shirt cutting tradition, but apparently there&#039;s a different local tradition here in Napa where I&#039;m learning to fly... I got a nice bottle of &quot;Napa Valley Airport&quot; 2005 Sarah signed by my instructor. :) When in Rome, I guess.


The incredible amount of information and tips I&#039;ve received from Jason have been immensely helpful. I think I&#039;ve watched nearly every video / webinar on the site and all three of his books.


Thank you again for everything and good luck to future pilots just getting started. I&#039;m sure today and the day I pass my checkride will be two days I remember vividly for the rest of my life.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just completed my first and second solos this past weekend and am thrilled!  I wasn&#039;t as nervous as I thought I&#039;d be.  I feel like it took awhile for me to get the landings down during my training but I was able to successfully complete my  solos.  This is a great site- thank you for all the information you provide Jason!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello Alonso, thanks for the advice, I&#039;ll keep that in mind. So do you have to learn or go through all the classes again even though you&#039;re technically a qualified private pilot? ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Confidence is key on the solo flight, specially the first one.

I am doing my second flight training after 11 years of no flying. Back in August 2000 I finished my first training and got mi PPL but right then I had to move to metropolitan area. Work, family, distance... it was impossible for me to excercise  my PPL. I recall the morning I first soloed, I was expecting to happen on that day, I felt confident of my ability to do it and it was no surprise when my instructor leave me inside the C172XP to perform the required circuits. It went smooth and joyful!

My second solo is not too far in the horizon...

		<description><![CDATA[My instructor says that I&#039;m very close to my first solo, and not quite there yet. I&#039;m still perfecting my landings. However, when it comes to take my first solo, I know I&#039;ll be excited and nervous at the same time. I&#039;m looking forward to it though. :D ]]></description>
