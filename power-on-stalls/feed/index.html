		<description><![CDATA[SB,

INSTRUMENT METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS (IMC) - Meteorological conditions expressed in terms of visibility, distance from clouds, and ceiling less than minima specified for visual meteorological conditions (VMC).

I agree that it&#039;s very useful to use the horizon to recover. The reason I showed the instruments as we approached the stall is because that&#039;s all you can really see anyways is instruments and sky.

Thanks for the comment!

SB,

The clouds are a SCT layer 2,000 feet below me. Not quite IMC
