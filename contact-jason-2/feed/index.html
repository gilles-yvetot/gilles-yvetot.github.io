		<description><![CDATA[Same thing happened to me when I was first learning to get my private pilot license. I accidentally put the 172 into a shallow spin during slow flight. It scared me half to death. Anyway, to show me that the Cessna was such a stable plane and easy to fly, he asked if he could show me a real spin. He did it, pretty much rolled the whole thing over and recovered like nothing happened. I realized hey that wasn&#039;t that bad. Haven&#039;t been nervous since. Actually slow flight and VMC demos are probably my favorite to perform. Hope that helps! ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jason,

I&#039;m a great fan of your material, and as a CFI I use your videos as resources for many of my students. I have come upon a roadblock for the first time and with only 500 hrs I&#039;m curious to see your view. My student is TERRIFIED of going slow, even on approach, and stalls. He was spun by his previous instructor and I think he&#039;s gonna have a panic attack every time we even get into slow flight. Any suggestions? Thanks. Keep up the great work.

		<description><![CDATA[Dear Jason

If any of your listeners are experiencing delays in accomplishing their dreams of flying, I would like to encourage them to NEVER EVER give up. I am not a pilot but I continually strive to be one.

My name is Dave and I am 52 yrs old. I have been fascinated with aviation since childhood. My goal to start my carreer in the Airforce Academy was soon shattered when I discovered alcohol at age 15. It quickly dictated how my life would go  until age 44. I have been free from alcohol and  cleaning up the wreckage of my past ever since 2002. I have between 2 and 3 yrs to go before that finacial black cloud passes in my life.

I have set out to earn my PPL a few times only to have it interupted by forgotten issues that I have had to deal with. I continually study and go up when I can. I also have a simulator that has many bells and whistles and it helps me to stay in tune with cockpit management and procedures. I have done much of my training at places like Cessna Flight Training/King Schools and I have also been an AOPA member for several years. I am also a fan of  MzeroA.com . I read all I can and grasp every opportunity that I can to learn, learn and learn some more.

Jason, I want you to know that I commend you in all that you are doing. Not only are you living your dream, you are freely passing your knowledge on to the rest of us. Sometimes it feels as if some are born to fail and that others have a thrust upon them. Life is like that sometimes. I still have all my limbs and my medical card so until they take that from me I will continue in my journey. Even if I lose those faculties I will still study. If anyone out there has ran into similar delays in life, please don&#039;t be discouraged! Don&#039;t compare your life with others either. We are all on a different journey and one day we will all have our own story to tell.

Best Wishes And Don&#039;t You Give Up

Dave Klem]]></description>
