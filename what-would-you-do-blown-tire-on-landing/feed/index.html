		<description><![CDATA[Yesterday I was flying back to my home airport from a day trip in a Piper Archer. Airport was reporting winds 240@8 and I was given the choice between 19 and 32. I opted for 32 as 8 knots is well withing my limits as well as the planes. Anyway I touched down lightly on the left main and continued down the runway, used aerodynamic breaking until the turn off where I applied slight braking pressure. Plane started to turn then is started to veer hard left. Into the the dirt I went. My initial reaction was that the front tire must have spun or something so I told tower I needed to get out and see what is going on. Shutdown, And it was a deflated left main. They sent a maintenance truck out there, put a new wheel on and i taxied to the shop. I got there and looked at the tire and there wasn&#039;t any damage to the tire at all. So much so, they are going to reuse it. They said the tube had ripped. They kept asking me if I landed hard and my answer was no. It was a typical light crosswind landing. Yes I had to letdown that tire first but it wasn&#039;t hard at all. They also asked if I checked tire pressure and I said I did a visual check before start- and they didn&#039;t look low. 
So I guess my question is, is this just bad luck, or is there something I am missing that I may done wrong to have caused this?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is an old post, but just had this happen to me today...
I got my PPL yesterday and was flying with an instructor today getting checked out in a different model 172.  On my last landing of the day, I did a short field landing and the right main tire blew.  Still not sure what happened, because it was not a hard landing, the tires weren&#039;t skidding, and it blew about 10ft before we came to a full stop.  When we got a look at it, the tire had come off the bead.  Not sure if this was after it went flat or if it went flat because it came off the bead...  They are going to pop a new tire on tomorrow, so hopefully I&#039;ll get a better idea of what happened when they get the old one off.  Any ideas?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jason,
   I came in on an ILS at night on 10/31 (wouldn&#039;t you know it) flared and had just touched down when the right main blew out and the skylane began to veer to the right.  I immediately corrected to the left and was able to maintain control of the airplane.  I added mild power and was able to taxi the plane to the tiedown spot.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Jason,


I am a pilot with around 250 hours.  i have my glider, SEL and instrument ratings.  The other day i was flying a diamond star DA40G  in fairly windy conditions (about 16G24).  While on final i had a bit of a left cross wind so i corrected as necessary.  The landing felt smooth but i may have been a little to angled.  After taxing i realized that i blew my nose wheel tire.  I guess i was just wondering what i could have done to prevent this from happening and also how common is this kind of thing.  I have never had anything happen to me like this so i am kind of disappointed in myself.

thanks, 
john]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was just thinking about this today and glad I found this video!  What would it feel like to have a tire blow?  Would it be extremely noticeable were a take off rejection is obvious? Or would you think something might be wrong and still continue with the take off?  The reason I ask is because being a student pilot I am inexperienced. I want to prepare myself for if that time ever does come so that I can react safely.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First, on approach, I would fly around to use up some fuel so there is less chance of a deadly explosion when the plane touches down. Then obviously I would lower the landing gear and prepare to land and then lower the plane gently down onto the runway. That&#039;s if the tyre(s) had blown out before the landing. Anyway I would use the rudder to keep control and let the aircraft coast to a halt. I do this on X-Plane 9 and it works.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ My name is Steve I have 700 hours and am scheduled for my Instrument check ride on 05/31/11. I own a 1968 PA-28-140 with the 160 HP upgrade based out of KWVI. On 05/19/11 on a trip to Sacramento I landed at Franklin Field (F72) To my surprise the nose wheel was completely flat (no blowout).  The aircraft shook and shimmed violently to say the least, I resisted heavy breaking for fear of a prop strike. I managed to stop the aircraft with very mild breaking in about 900&#039; I believe the nose wheel did most of the breaking. By the attitude of the aircraft, about 5 degree pitch down and the sounds and feel  I thought I lost the entire nose strut and steering assembly. Steering was only about 10 percent (or less). The rudder peddles felt jammed and I was unable to clear the active. Two hours and $580 later every thing worked out just fine (no other damage). I will say one thing, the ride to a stop was an &quot;E&quot; ticket . I was glad to know that my adrenal glands and sphincter muscle were working perfectly that day.
Always stay alert. anything can happen at any time. A good friend told me that flying consist of hours of boredom accented by moments of shear terror. Have fun and be safe.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We had both main tires blow just after touch down at about 65 KIAS last night while flying the 172S...it stops fast. You likely won&#039;t have to do much if both fail tires deflate at the same time. The plane stopped quickly and on the runway. But what I want to know is why both tires blew. If we landed with our feet on the brakes at 65KIAS can this cause the tires to blow simultaneously, and without skidding first, or sliding? After reading a bit, it appears under-inflation, or not using a lubricant, or bead sealer can maybe cause the bead to break loose with braking on touch down, or hard barking?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, I had a front tire go flat in flight today. Landed as normal had difficulting keeping center of runway. Realized I had a flat applied slight power full back yoke, had very little trouble taxing onto a taxiway. Shut down had towed to hanger, now wondering what the damaged bill will be. The aircraft is Cessna 182, had to put air in tire 2 days ago, tire looked good on preflight, (should of checked with gauge) a good landing on mains, taxied 250 feet on tire, any thoughts about possible damage other than the tire.

		<description><![CDATA[Dennis&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hi. I am a student with 16 hrs. Yesterday we were doing touch and goes and we agreed I was ready for my first solo.  I did a full stop,  backtracked and was exiting the taxiway when the front tire went flat.  If the tire went flat after I dropped off my Instructor and was on my takeoff  role doing 45 or 50 kts then what?.]]></description>

<p>a tire that blows, should have been noticed before takeoff.  but i have seen people<br />apply the brakes, feet on the top of the pedal as opposed to heals on the floor.</p>
<p>even a worn tire probably would not blow by itself on landing.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Dave!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Awesome advice! I agree with your idea of &quot;minimal braking&quot; really if any at all! The thing is the airplane is going to go where it wants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jason]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m only a student pilot at 51 yrs of age with about 24 hrs but I have been around airplanes and hangars for many years. Like many enthusiasts, life gets in the way of our pilot dreams. I have also been a truck driver since 1980 and have much experience with rubber meeting the road.&lt;br&gt;Similar to a blowout in a car--power to idle, steer straight ahead (straight line as much as possible), use brakes as little and as gently as possible.  In a small single-engine plane that may mean no brakes at all.  AFTER you have come to a stop and everything is under control (no smoke, etc.) call the tower and tell them what happened.  You will most likely want to have the plane towed rather than attempting to taxi it for at least two reasons: 1. You don&#039;t want to incur further damage to the aircraft, and 2. You probably won&#039;t be able to control it adequately anyway.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;I have personally never had a blowout but was on board a plane that  landed with an extremely soft tire and the above worked for him.  The plane will have a lot of drag on the side with the flat tire if it is a main gear tire that is flat.  In my experience talking with mechanics, the most frequent cause of blowouts is pilots landing with their feet on the brakes.  I know it sounds silly but it&#039;s true.  After you land and apply the brakes, it takes a fair amount of pressure on the top of the rudder pedal to lock up a tire, but if the brake is already locked before touch-down the wheel never has a chance to turn and it will burn through the tire and tube in a heartbeat.  I have been taught to land the plane with our heels on the floor so we have good rudder control but no access to the brake portion of the pedal.  Most people don&#039;t have big enough feet to apply toe brakes with their heels on the floor and it only takes a second to slide your feet up to the top of the rudder pedals after you are rolling down the runway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On a nosewheel blowout you should be able to use differential breaking and keep the yoke pulled back in order to keep minimal pressure on the the nose gear as on a grass runway landing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope that helps]]></description>
